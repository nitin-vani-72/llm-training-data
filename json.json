I also have, you know, noted the points that you mentioned that you would like to receive from this workshop. Is there anything else that you feel that, you know, we as coaches should know about, you know, you or the team or whatever, so that when we are coming for a workshop that we design specifically for you, it may help."

And I'm sure, you know, you know, there are going to be discussions, but try not to dwell too much on the negotiation basics, you know, because I'll be very frank here. You know, we have all been doing this job tick, and we are dealing with multiple people. So what happens is a lot of these communication, you know, workshops don't. Well, on the real issues, they can come to us on teaching what is negotiation? You know, I've been learning that from the MBA days. I'll be very probably would know it."

			"role": "user",
			"content": "Absolutely. We're doing it on the job on a daily basis. Don't go on the negotiation, you know, on what are the different tactics of negotiation. Try to give us real life issues, you know, which we are trying to share with you and make the role plays very effective, you know, on how it can be effective. That is one thing. Second is, you know, a lot of times, a lot of training programs try to keep it very clear as if the life is, you know, a blackboard and, you know, everything is black, which is not. Yeah."

The other, you know, 115 minutes are actually gossip or, you know, other shit, you know, that we have to discuss with them."
		},
		{
			"role": "user",
			"content": "Yeah. So what happens is, you know, a lot of times you guys just focus on those five minutes. That's not how it works."

		{
			"role": "assistant",
			"content": "Yeah. The major part is the other conversation that you."
