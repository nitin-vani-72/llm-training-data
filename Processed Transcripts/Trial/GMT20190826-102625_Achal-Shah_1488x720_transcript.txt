Speaker B: What do you mean? Last it was struggle. One thing I was. I got it. But.
Speaker A: That'S just tell me your process. What do you do? So if you come up with a word, what do you do about it.
Speaker B: Means correct with correct word and the correct position. The correct application is not in one mind also there. If any. If any of the asking me question that I will left on my company also. I think why you not I will worry is also is available but determined. But in mind of forgiveness struggle. Okay. What about you yesterday, sorry. Last time you heard that you come from Abyss. Now because the information technology. So you got it. But I will fulfill it and message also. You write that. But after that I will go back to running our also in our vehicle there's a lot of thinking source of mind. Lot of thinking of the mind. I will information technology also. Sorry. Stock tensorflow. Then one political, then one medical is almost available in mind. But in current position also. But not mind. In our words also correct.
Speaker A: Mind does not work when it's supposed to go swimming.
Speaker B: Mind of application is not a working that this is my problem also.
Speaker A: No. Whenever we are reading anything, right? Yes, that is very good. So when we come across some word that we don't understand. First try to predict by the sentence what is. What do you think it can say? That is the first thing that we do. Search for the meaning. So when we search for the meaning that we noted down somewhere. It can be your mobile. In your mobile notes also. Or if you prefer a paper and pen, you can write a. Write it in a paper and pen. The word, the meaning. Now, immediately when you have read the meaning, make a sentence out of it. Write it below the word. Wherever you're noting it down, that is the first step. So whatever you're reading, do that. Keep reading newspapers. Daily.
Speaker B: Daily. Yes. Okay. I will prepare that.

Speaker A: And something called as inshort, right?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Inshort app we had means we had suggested. Am I correct?

Speaker B: In 60 words. Okay, sir.
Speaker A: So that is also good. So whenever you are traveling or sitting somewhere, you can just browse. When you're browsing, you can read. You can improve your language as well. So download this inshort app. Also. If you not get time, it is. You will constantly keep reading something that if you want to write something short, language has to be very good.
Speaker B: Yes, sir. This is only so much.

Speaker A: But fluency is not that. The flow is not that we're not able to find the right words. Right. So tell me, how do you go back home? How do you commute back to home? Tell me that. Is it by bike or local? Local. Train or bus? What do you do? Hello.
Speaker B: Hello, sir.
Speaker A: How do you travel back home? After office? Is it through bike?
Speaker B: Bus? Yes. Half noise? Yes. No, sir. 45 minutes. Also bus.
Speaker A: Okay. So you have your own vehicle. Right?
Speaker B: Yes. I own vehicle also.
Speaker A: Okay. So what I want you to do is in the evening when you're home, spend five to ten minutes. You don't need more than that. What you're supposed to do is now I want to recap the whole day in your head. But I want to recap in English. So to think in English. Right.

Speaker A: So this is the time I woke up. Then I went to my desk. Then I opened my mails. This was the mail. This is what I replied to the mail. Or this is what we discuss in the meeting. So think all of that in English. Right?
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: What will happen? You will find something. Okay. Meeting in the meeting. I said something in Tamil now. But how do I say it in English? So you will able to think that. So every day we have a gap, right? The gap is I said it in Tamil, but I want to say it in English and think. If you're not able to say. Okay, how do I do this? Use the svopt tool to form a sentence every day we are filling our gaps more and more fluent.
Speaker B: Because the every day what we are supposed to say.
Speaker A: How we are supposed to say it. And then our flow will increase very well.
Speaker B: Okay. So then if any doubts. Now you. Anytime you call back, sir. If any.
