Speaker A: Tivani that you are using the concept that we have discussed. So any difficulties that you are facing.
Speaker B: I just want to ask some Matlab. We have to again and again upload the video for explain yourself or your job profile.
Speaker A: Correct. Anything else? I'll go in detail for that.
Speaker B: No, nothing else. Otherwise I was just bit confusing. Like, oh, again and again we have to record it for ourselves and then you will give us a marks. Why? Say, you know, sir, I thought it was like.
Speaker A: So that is why we have had this call. So in the last week, we wanted everyone to explore, give a hand on it if they're comfortable with the app or not. And now, and we have explained the concept again, but we'll explain it again now that you are comfortable with the app itself. So no issues in recording and submitting, correct?
Speaker B: No, no, it's absolutely fine.
Speaker A: And are you recording from an app or are you submitting it from a desktop? How are you doing that?
Speaker B: I'm recording it on the mobile and.
Speaker A: I'm submitting mobile only itself. Okay, great.
Speaker B: Yeah, take it.

Speaker A: So first, what I will do is that I will show you a pre report, pre assessment report. Okay. So report is made on the basis of a first interaction.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: The first interaction we had the. Before the program. Correct.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Through that we'll understand around four capabilities. But before we dive into that, let's try to understand what we are trying to do with an example. Let's just. After two months, you have part, you have to participate in a marathon, 30 kilometer marathon. Okay. So how will you prepare for that?
Speaker B: Uh, first I will, uh, on the. Before the marathon date, one week, uh, before I try to run a maximum of two to 3 km every day. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. For two, three days, I'll run for almost two to 3. After the event is approaching here, I will run almost 10. I'll prepare myself that I'll wake up in the morning, I'll have to follow a shik diet, I'll have to lose some weight. And then I have to think that I'm much lighter than when I'm running. Yeah, that's it.
Speaker A: Right. So you understand the most important criteria here is if you're running aimlessly, it doesn't, it doesn't really matter. Just because you're tired doesn't mean it can be also 500 meters. You're tired because you're not running at all.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: The most important part was that you measure the progress. Right. If it be it in terms of kilometers, the time covered, the stamina, increase the weight that you need. Right. For optimum, optimally completing that racetrack. Right. Within the time stipulated time itself.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: The same way. What is our marathon network? What is our final test? The audit.
Speaker B: Yeah, audit. Audit is the final destination, but.

Speaker A: Yeah. Right. So that is our final test. Right. And that is where we see all. All of it converge at one point. This is what matters. Yeah. So that is what we're preparing for as. As well. And these are our parameters. Okay. So we're seeing whenever you're trying to submit something, something called as proceed to self evaluation is coming back and is asking you to work on these parameters of parameters code they call evaluate. Correct.
Speaker B: Right.
Speaker A: Things like these are up. Correct. We would have seen that.
Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah, I've seen this.
Speaker A: All right. So that now these are the same parameters. This case we are going to prepare as your mobile screen. Tell me if I need to zoom in a little bit more closer.
Speaker B: It is visible. Yeah. Yeah, it is.
Speaker A: All right. Perfect.
Speaker B: All right.
Speaker A: That. So that it's visible for you.
Speaker B: Okay. Yeah.

Speaker A: Now we'll try to understand these so that you can self evaluate yourself as well. Self evaluation will be very important. So not, not. Because until we realize what mistakes we are doing, the progress is a little difficult. Right. We just can't be dependent. Yeah, that doesn't really help if you know that, you know, I have to do 3 km today so that I can run 5 km in the next week. So it has to be done by you. Right. So of course, I'll be providing my inputs. From time to time, I'll providing my. Provide my inputs. Any concepts. If I feel there's a concept that needs to be taken, I will cover that in the coaching call. I will cover that in the IVLP that are coming up.
Speaker B: Okay? Yes.
Speaker A: Let's understand the first one. The first one is around thinking. Thinking is all about how you're structuring your ideas. The details that you are covering. Are you able to understand what the audience really requires? Someone level one to two. Right. Will have insufficient details. So this you have to identify when you are hearing your own recording, after you record it, you have to identify which level do I? From your perspective. Right. And it can also happen. You believe you're on level five to six. But as a coach, as my expert, I goes, I see it's level three or four. Level two sometimes. That is. It will also give me an idea. This is what needs to be covered with dish. Right? What's missing here. Right.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: That way we are validating what you understand. What we. I understand. And we can bridge that.
Speaker B: Right?
Speaker A: So first is insufficient details, right? So it never covered enough detail for someone to understand the level. Three to four is where you talked about, let's say, ten things, but they didn't make sense. Why? Because it was not a logical sequence. The details were not enough. All of those things. Five is where the content is well structured. Insights are clear. It's easy to understand level set to it. The highest level is someone who can anticipate what the audience needs right away.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Audience needs sometimes can be auditor also, what question is he asking? Right? Because the most important question is someone who was on level thinking. Level seven to eight is able to understand. And that is where we will try to reach. Can I just give you one moment? There's someone at the door. One moment. Articulation is all about your choice of words. Okay? If someone is on level, one to two is someone who speaks in phrase, is not able to construct complete sentences. It's heavily translated from the mother tongue. Due to which the choice words is very generic, or sometimes not even aligning with what they are trying to express. On the second level is someone who can construct sentences, but the meaning can be unclear. Same because of the choice of words that they have used. So, for example, words like I'm doing, going, taking, right. It's not. They are not precise. If you. Someone says, I'm doing presentation, so doing word is not required. Presenting itself is an action word. I'm presenting, for example. Right. Make it more precise. Right. Your language becomes more precise.
Speaker B: That's.
Speaker A: Then you. Come on. Someone can construct sentences even if it goes simple, it has clear meaning. The meaning is not distorted. The last one is when you're able to use the words to create an impact.
Speaker B: Okay? Impact.
Speaker A: Yes. Impactful in the sense, is able to beautify. The language is very specific and clear.
Speaker B: Right.

Speaker A: So audience is able to imagine what exactly the person is trying to say. Accuracy is all about you as you digressed grammar. So for example, someone on the first level, his grammar is such that it affects the clarity of the sentence itself. You're not able to understand what they're saying. It's very difficult to understand. Second level is there are grammatical errors, but errors that affect the hygiene. Just say messio pt kibat k. The word. Let's say the word order is little different, or the tense is wrong. Someone who says, I woke up at seven. He says, I wake up or at seven or on seven.
Speaker B: Right.
Speaker A: So you approximately understand what they're trying to say. But some of the other grammatical errors are present. Next is rare grammatical errors. With someone who barely noticed. Last is no grammatical mistakes at all. Presence is self explanatory. But the first level is someone who's visibly nervous. The voice is unclear. Right. So that clear name. Right. To which it is difficult to understand. That accent also can be difficult. Right. Then is more. The next level is someone has a monotonous voice. There's no change in the way that they speak. No inflections, no pauses.
Speaker B: Right.
Speaker A: So it's the achy tone with the boring. Right. Accent is there. But the words are understandable. Men is someone whose voice sounds confident as an indian accent. But it is very understandable. And last is a strong executive presence. Right. Now according to my assessment, 423-4234 right. This is where we believe we are.
Speaker B: Sort of.
Speaker A: Sometimes it is translational. Sometimes you are able to do that. But overall your assessment. This is a heavy thing where we are. Okay.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Now one more thing that I wanted to share. Let me share my screen. Yeah. Let me open.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Call minute there. Let me open the. Your playbook. Igloo assignment Abhi maneuver. You would have seen my comments. But you will look at these comments merit attempts. This one was for explaining your job profile. Apka first joy. 10,000.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Say Sapna warehouse. What is the warehouse department? What are they supposed to do? Right. And what do you mean? You say you look after two units. What is a unit?
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Right. For example, we are having. Those are grammatical. May. We are having 53 employees. So having. Normally I'm having breakfast, right. I think a Matlab car. 53 employees. It is a very common, common mistake. Right. But this is what needs to be correct.
Speaker B: What we can use there. Like we are.
Speaker A: So if you say we have 53 employees. It is correct. But if you say having those. Come on.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: It's a little funny.
Speaker B: Yes.

Speaker A: But that's how. Sometimes that's how the english language is. It needs to be precise. We have 53 employees under. Under my department. Right. I have a team of 53. Etcetera. But having changes the meaning completely. For example. And do their work sincerely. Late do is not required. They work sincerely.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Same. Having. Huh. The lupid plan that is situating. Goa has two units. Two units of water. SSL precision. Say. Now one more thing. Now let me go to your view. Apka. View. Now one thing that I now does. Of course. This. That also clears. K. Abu Pujara senaki practice kidney bar Karna. That's to get it. When you keep practicing every day. You also keep improving every day.
Speaker B: Correct? Yeah.
Speaker A: Practices it. We'll also try to keep including more and more practices. Just a minute. So just say practice report of warehousing deviation. We try to add similar situations as much as we can. So you can practice that. Now, the most relevant practice can also be something called as daily diary. So you have to practice every day as much as you can. Daily diary is something simple. Your varros car. We are practice. But that way try to cover in as much detail as possible. Why? Because when you try to cover in detail, you have to explain every incident, everything that happened, every emotion that happened, every conversation that happens. That way you're practicing more and more in English now. What? As I said, every time it is just as important to record. It is just as important to self evaluate. Because we need to know how much we are running. So we need to know what progress we are making, what mistakes we are making. Correct. Hello.
Speaker B: Okay. Hi. Hello.
Speaker A: Yes. Upcoming video stop Kara stream to a bandwidth issue.
Speaker B: All right.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Now you see something called as create reflection here.
Speaker B: Okay. Right.
Speaker A: Let's say apnea will be submission here. You submitted it, you self evaluated it. Okay. How much is. How much magic is next time is for example. Right. But have to write it down somewhere. Right? I'm not bull Jatanito. It is possible that we forget there are lots of exercising and doing it every day. Right.
Speaker B: Okay.

Speaker A: Reflection Karo. It's a daily diary. So that's in my first attempt. Attempt. I need to improve on the following. Yeah. Kuchiya achievement post Karogi. I'll just show I deleted later. Right. A post Karo home page eleven other hashtag behave up use curve. That is very important because you need to track your progress. Okay, so, uh, what I wanted to share. Okay, let me open the mobile app. Mobile app create reflection. They will come make hold. Wrong. This is Kobe. Okay, let me see if you can see the screen.
Speaker B: Yeah, I can.
Speaker A: You can see, right? Yeah. Okay.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: So you discuss the correct discuss.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: See, introduce yourself, discuss option discuss up. Click. Then we'll create reflection. Post they oppose reflection.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: So discuss and create reflection. So that is how you be able to do that. As you understand jitna important. Recording a utna important self reflection and writing that reflection is important self assessment and reflection. Okay. I hope that addresses the doubt that you wanted to ask me.
Speaker B: Okay, so much guess.
Speaker A: Right. So. And, uh, I think there was a few, uh, there was one confusion, like ten assignments but merit. So it's not assignments, it's number of recording, number of submissions that you do.
Speaker B: Okay. I was thinking that Oski below something would come and I would do it for that. I would do the recording. But a business.
Speaker A: Yes. The whole idea is to practice so much, right. Because of actual audit. Ho that at least language is not the issue you're very comfortable with in expressing anything. So confidence will also be a byproduct because you're confident with the language. Right. And if you have.
Speaker B: Yeah, actually I was using the hello. English app. Yeah, we have been there. We are included in there. So there are lessons are coming. Yeah. So that we are getting lessons there on our drop down list. So we have to attempt that lesson and we have to go forward.

Speaker A: But this is a concept, this is to practice. Don't use now use both. A very good. Right. So hello. English sub english concepts. We have a secret, right?
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Apply curry and see if actually is happening. Right. It's making a change or not.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: That is why. But next time with each recording you should improve concepts for us. Apply tapas speedy recovery, improvement. That's good. Do the. Do both English BCK apply concept discuss. We'll do that. Create have a repository. Right. The word bank. Just whatever words you're learning. Write them down if you want. Write it in the reflection. Also you have nav words apply here.
Speaker B: Okay, I'll do that. Yeah.
Speaker A: That will also make a lot of sense. Right.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: And in case of any queries do reach out to me. And if the Sapka warehousing here. Correct department. So housing related other situation change. I want to add a situation where something you face every day. You talk on that every day and you want to practice it here. If you want to reflect on it, you can write to me. So this is a practice that I want and we'll create that for you.
Speaker B: Okay, no problem. I'll do that.
Speaker A: And as a lag discuss karnata. I will try and call you up also for them.
Speaker B: Okay, no problem.
Speaker A: Keep practicing this. Very good. Thank you for your practices. So we can pay if you get some time. Record kirkhair if you can do that, that would be great.
