Speaker B: Okay. Okay.

Speaker A: Can you hold it up as a hold. Kia sana. Top Internet. Somehow I don't know what the reason was. Right. When you're holding it. I don't know what the reason is. Right. So I think I'm holding right now. Okay. So what we feel is that I'm assuming that there are lots of ideas in our heads. Yeah. Both sorry, ideas here. Or. But we, when we're going in a flow, we might not really understand what is the right sequence to the story that we want to explain. Correct?
Speaker B: Absolutely.

K. First boss, happy days. Check up schooling the family. Right. Father Chalaga. Mother was labeled as a potter Ganesh. And then this has a sequence after this one story.

Speaker A: Let's go. Sequence. Now. First question is first time village sequence set. Abini Karna. The first question is asking why? Whatever. Okay. Why do I want to do this, right? Or maybe what do I really want to show mary childhood story Agamemnon. But village can you notice a pattern? Stealing mangoes. Naughty nature. So do you see a sequence? What are exactly trying to tell here?
Speaker B: Okay, so we can say that in childhood when I was living in my village that time I was very naughty.
Speaker A: And so all your stories are revolving around your naughty nature. Correct. So. Okay. So a theme. Milya, why I'm telling the. How I'm doing this? I want to tell you that I was such a. Of a. Not in nature. And you also wanted to mention key. Let's say uh. After 9th I changed, right?
Speaker B: Yes, yes.

Speaker A: Okay. All of these things are. So that is the main theme. Now how will you do it? Now you need to set a sequence, right? So maybe how will you start up?
Speaker B: I will start sir, when I was in childhood. Childhood.
Speaker A: Then I don't want you to tell me. Now I don't want you to tell me. Now I want you to tell what do you feel? Logic Batami.
Speaker B: First we are talking about the childhood and after that we will talk about the village and then we will tell about our nuttiness nature. After that we tell about this. When I was in school that time I also very naughty. But I'm a very helping nature. I always to help my colleague and my friends. When I went to the school by the cycle that time I got hurt and my father scolded me. One day I was stealing the mango in the background of the backside of the school with my friend. That time also we are escorted by my teachers. After that. After that we can say that my best friend was Nandik Shore. Initially we can. First we can. We can talk about the childhood. Childhood. After that we talk about the my village and in my village once our.
Speaker A: Sequence said karna has what. What would be the logic right now if you are telling me someone who does not know anything about your childhood, right. Think of it. If I start with one kahase tha ma'am. Miracles background rahe. Right. Mirror friends conscious. So that makes more sense for me. So you. Maybe I'll tell first about little of my nature. A few examples, right? So uska sapsi you will sequence it so that becomes your house. How will I explain my nature? And how is the. What is the best way to express this in a sequence right now if we now the same way. Koibi presentation. For example Apka IVLP topic.
Speaker B: Topic. Negative growth of the shells during the pandemic. Pandemic situation. Negative growth. Negative growth of the shell during the pandemic situation.

Speaker A: Right. Managers are a manager. Topic path. Correct. All of those things are there. Pain points. So many pain points. Here. Pain points came from the same idea that there's so many ideas of what? Pain points. Okay. Pain points. Now what we need to tell solutions, right? Because that is what you have to explain, right. Strategies. We needed strategies. Correct. Strategies. I'm not put here, right. So when you have all the ideas there, then you go in the sequence. Why am I giving this presentation to explain the strategies. All right. So how will I do it? I first set the reference first. So that they understand what we are talking about. Then I will put or put forward all the problems that are existing. And then I will provide solutions. And how will I implement them? Just action plan. So that will help you to set your thoughts. That sorta see mind map use kanika trica. Correct the a tool up. We are now apply. Try to apply. It will be a good meeting of draw karo. So samaj magic. Okay. Even you can negate. Okay. Yes. You get it. For example, let's say.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Right. First time cinema hall we cancel karakto. Let's for example, right? Many go. So you will understand.
Speaker B: According to your thinking.
Speaker A: According to one thing. I just example here may lobby cancel from ten to 20 things you can say this is not required. This is required because even in the IVLP you saw we didn't apply all of them right. Which is energy coaches which is implement kia there are always ideas which we can apply wardyas which we need to. This is not required as of now. Correct. Now abhi they come. If we quickly go through the feedback that you had received in the IV LPTK major feedback. Wait a minute. Add more points and speak more elaborate zadakaro and one more thing I think the suggest is that need to spend more time on improving articulation and accuracy. Right now mainly thought, thought and thinking structure okay. Right. Jana cheki as a prepare karna methodology presentation I conversation I meeting I. You'll be able to prepare in a sequence that is very easy to understand and I'm elaborately but you understand can make a statement bold raw people need more elaboration because you have to try to imagine. Try to actually visualize because you are on the field. Right. And you need to explain something to your superior what is going on. So how will you do it? What are the data points that you will tell because this is the problem. This many doctors this many are so reduces like 50%. Okay. I reduce just customers 50% reduce. So my sales is taking hit by 30% directly. Products are down under stays down to 30%. Correct. You have to explain this is the situation. This is what has happened. So it will help you to construct your thoughts. Now how will we work on articulation and accuracy now when you look at your sentences do you feel or achieve correct.
