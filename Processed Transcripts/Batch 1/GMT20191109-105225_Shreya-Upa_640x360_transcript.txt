Speaker A: Okay. Okay.
Speaker B: And one more thing. Audience here there is no audience. So there is no fear.

Speaker A: You're giving me the presentation as in so exactly. Like for example, if you are presenting to people who already are familiar with terminology, use Gardo unko defined Nakaro Unpe time based Nakaro. What other muje presentation there you'll have to define, right?
Speaker B: Yes ma'am.
Speaker A: Right. So you get that so correct audience. And for example you spent 1 second on. Good. Good evening. You spent 1 second on what is your topic? You spent 1 second on. You know my name is this. So Usmapke precious seconds proper yet actually whenever you present, right?
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Right. So. But yapkile kitna useful. How long. How many times in a. You know, in a year or in a month do you have to actually give presentations?
Speaker B: That is not dependent in a month we can give two, three in sometime in a month. Also we don't give. So that depends upon the. That depends on the condition. Whether they are making every schedule. Our juniors can learn something. So if required we have to give two three classes. If required. We are not able to give one class. Also if there is some more. If client required then we have to present. If clients require this one then we don't have to present it. Our management if early 2000 we can present them. So that is not. It is not fixed ma'am.
Speaker A: Right. So. But all of these presentations would be technical because it would depend on the work that you're doing, right?
