Speaker B: Hello.
Speaker A: How are you?
Speaker B: Yeah, good afternoon. I am fine.
Speaker A: How are you doing great. Doing great. So what is happening with you yesterday? Were you busy?
Speaker B: Actually I was at a client place.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: So there was a meeting and it was extended up to 06:00 so what.
Speaker A: Is the general meetings that you have? How does it go?
Speaker B: Basically since I am from the estimation department, tendering department. So our meeting is the to get the order and it's a challenging order to back the order in this competitive market. So all the types of negotiation with the client then the technical, their confidence. And I have also written a topic from the negotiation part only.
Speaker A: Nice.
Speaker B: So I will sharing with you. Just.
Speaker A: You can share it on the screen.
Speaker B: Yeah.

Speaker A: So can you just give me detailing about how does the meeting go on? I mean how does it start and then what all do you discuss?
Speaker B: I have shared my screen.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: So basically what is things is like that client gives us the inquiry. That is the first with the tender requirement. And as per the capability of the individual as well as the overall capability of the company. Two aspects are there. One is the technical capability. Another is the financial capability. So first they are checking the financial capability of the company. Since it. Since it is a. As example, it is a project of the 200 crore. Either company is capable for this project or not. So there is a certain criteria there. For 200 crore minimum turnover should be 800 crore. Four times of the projects. That is the price. Sorry.
Speaker A: That benchmark. Do you guys know before only that.
Speaker B: Gate benchmark is set by the customer only.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: Sometimes for the. Basically we dealt with the government PSU customer. So benchmark is very much mandatory requirement. If it it is a private customer, some decision or mutual agreement can be done. Then the second thing is that technical expect. Technical expects since say it is a project of the pipeline. So that type of project we have done earlier had we have the experience for these particular projects and how it is. And you have the proven track record. It's called a PTR. You have the proven track record. So just like a certificate. I have done this coaching class.
Speaker A: So you have.
Speaker B: You will give a certificate. So I have basically done this with a completion and successful that type of record they are asking. So these two criteria to be matched first. Then as per their technical clarification, whatever they have given technical requirement. This is such like a house. If we built our own house. We used to give a mason conductor or builder whatever. So now builder is us on the big value, right. We are just constructing some industrial plants for the end user. So first we need to know what's their requirement first? Mandatory requirement is over. Now what their requirement? They have given some written space. Then as per the discussion with the across the table discussion is because some queries we have they have answered and some queries they have also we have to attend. So there is the technical clearance first technical clearance on the basis of the documents done. Then it's coming to the negotiation part. Negotiation part coming basically by the commercial. So they have certain budget for this particular things. Since I am going to build a house, I have a budget, say 20 crore budget is there or 20 lakhs budget is there. So they have certain budgets. We have to estimate the cost first. We have to submit the cost to them if it is under the budget. They also negotiate with us if it is more higher than the budget. They want to discuss each and every cases with the particular thing and they basically want what the price say. There is an item of 20 numbers of items. So where the cost is their cost is x, my cost is two x. Why it is two x. They need to understand first what is my basis of that x cost, why it is too higher from their budgeted cost is their budgeting is wrong or my costing is wrong? That individual sequencing is there. Then after only if everything is okay, then we have to add our overhead, margin, completion period, company overhead, everything. Then it's a mutual discussion between them and us. If we are agreeing on the targeted cost, the will give us the order. If we are not capable to take the order on such a value or management approval is not there, then we have to lost that. So that is the overall procedure to basically as a tender from the initial to completion. Then we back the order after bagging the order. Lots of procedures there also for the internal handing over to our project team, execution team. Lots of things is there.
Speaker A: So nice. I mean it's quite a complex process.
Speaker B: Not complex actually. It's a first time. So we are habituated on that process.

Speaker A: So in this particular steps that you have done actually that you have, you know, summarized within five minutes. Do you know that? And it was so clear.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Everything, the whole process, you have some. You were able to brief in five minutes. That was brilliant. I really like the way you articulated and explained things. So in this particular procedure that you have in the tendering process and all, where do you specifically pitch in?
Speaker B: Sorry?
Speaker A: Where do you specifically pitch in?
Speaker B: Basically sometimes such type of clients is there and their requirement basically something they are required. They have required some acs. I am not technically going to you in the automation sector. I just example what we are using in the daily life. So they are asking for the search acs. What requirement is. Okay, so you have. Yes. So automation sector they are asking for a such a flow rate. They required say it is a line size of the eight inch.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: 18 line size. We have to calculate the mass flow meter calculation. Mass flow meter is basically giving us the mass of the flow rate. So for the 18th line size we are calculating as per our sizing calculation and the technical feasibility it should be four inch but four inch they are asking mass flow meter depends on the accuracy, velocity and the flow rate. So flow rate they are asking 800 meters cube per hour. But they are also asking h parallel .05% accuracy. So that not to be combined in this size range. So we have to go ahead with the higher size range. If we go ahead with the higher side size then overall pipe size need to be changed. So that type of difficulties is there on the technical aspect, commercial aspect also there is something. They are also calculating before releasing a tender. They are also calculating each and every item cost. Sometimes there is a huge mistake on the cost. My cost is eight lakhs. Their cost is full lakhs. Sometimes it is almost the 50% discount they are asking which is very difficult. So that is the main challenges for a proposal and estimation engineer. That is the main challenges to match up the price.
Speaker A: To build up confidence between your estimation and the client estimation.
Speaker B: Client estimation that is on the commercial aspect and the technical aspect also what they are want to sometimes clients is basically they are proposing I need to build this type of houses. So I don't have the total design of the houses. So we have to build up as per their requirement. Sometimes that challenges is there. Their requirement is such or with the requirement cost is low. So that is a being a solution provider. That is our first day. We have to consider their requirement first, their cost first and build also confidence on them. Because customer is not for the one time. Our basically customer is Adani Iocl. So that is a long term business. If we build up for one one order with them then it's a monopoly to us automatically order will come. Order will come. If they confident on us, they will automatically call us from their side only and give us the order. That is the basis and that is our basically that Kra key result areas.
Speaker A: Nice. Good to know.

Speaker B: It's interesting one actually day before yesterday I was at Adani Ahmedabad. So that's why the meeting was on first half but it was extended to second half also. That's why I have to cancel your call.
Speaker A: Nah, it's fine, it's fine. You are already on pass, so it's fine. You can take some gaps.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Okay. So this is the note study I prepared, huh?
Speaker B: That is as per your discussion I have prepared as note. I don't got so much of time.
Speaker A: So say, basically, let's say you have gone through those documents, right?
Speaker B: Yes, yes, I have gone through the documents.
Speaker A: So now, whatever I have discussed with you regarding the document, that is in very brief format.
Speaker B: Yes.

Speaker A: And whatever you have read after that, and then applying your own perception, did you make out any sort of particular examples? Can you share your learnings through the document? Any disagreements? Also fine.
Speaker B: The first things is that. What's my weakness? Was there mind mapping with a spontaneous reaction when the opposition in the client side. Sometime our management side asks a question. So I know the answer. I know the answer very well. I am very much aware about the fact, but I not able to give the proper answer on that continuous moment. So that is the mind mapping is basically. And mind mapping a thought process. So that is from your document. That's the main thing. How to do the mind mapping in a proper way. And the thought process also when we are going to elaborate some articles, something. So what is the major key points need to be elaborated, need to be discussed.
Speaker A: So that is brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. If you're able to correlate the learnings that we are, you know, trying to emulate in the coaching sessions and then apply it in your work life.
Speaker B: Yes, perfect.
Speaker A: Good. That you are able to correlate and then use it. And as you said, mind map actually helps in that regard because now you're cataloging your information into specific dimensions, it becomes easier for you to extract that particular information and then react spontaneously.
Speaker B: Yes.

Speaker A: Good. Great. So don't worry, whatever you have prepared this plan as of now, we can work on it. I'll give you some additional tools regarding articulation. Okay, so let's go through. Let me go through this first and then give you some, you know, on spot feedback regarding the same. Can I read it?
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: So while, so as a third person read this document, how will it be?
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: You might read it in a different way. I might in a different way. Let's try to correlate that.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: The elementary point, which are mandatory approach to tough negotiations are described below.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: The elementary point.
Speaker B: Yes, yes.
Speaker A: Your shared point. Define, share the glossary, identify conflicts, share perspectives and expect exceptional expectational on the requirement and expectations. Not expectational. Yes, expectation expectations of the requirements or expectations on the requirements, correct?
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Justify the requirement needed. Justify the requirement needed.
Speaker B: Needed. Yes.
Speaker A: Or you can say justify the requirement needs or justify the requirements is fine because requirement and need both are synonymous requirements.
Speaker B: Yes.

Speaker A: See as you kept with the prioritize the requirements. This is a nice line. Okay. So the negotiations shall start with project definition in detail with our consideration agreed. Deviation and technical solution provide to customer in an accordance with the predefined scope. Something is not right. Ignition shall be shall start with project definition in detail with our consideration. You know, with our consideration agreed. Deviation and technical solution provided to the customer. Census is missing for you. Provided to the customer in accordance with the predefined scope technical specification and requirement. Example for any project first approach to customer shell understanding. Oh, grammar, grammar. Grammar. For any project, the first approach for a customer is to understand about the project work scope.
Speaker B: Yeah. Of project score. Of.
Speaker A: About understand about the project work score.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Better proposition. You can put comma after the first for any project, the first approach is any project.
Speaker B: The first approach to customer to understand about the projects works.
Speaker A: The first approach for a customer or to a customer.
Speaker B: First approach to customer is okay. I think.
Speaker A: See, it doesn't make sense when you say the first approach to customer to understand, okay.
Speaker B: For a customer, then.
Speaker A: For a customer is to understand about the project work scope. Or you kept scope. No. So the is not required is to understand about project work scope. System architecture of the system of the overall system.
Speaker B: Basically.
Speaker A: You can reframe it saying that overall system architecture better.
Speaker B: That is, can better.
Speaker A: Agreed. Deviation during pre bid meetings. Nice. Present the technical solution in accordance with technical compliance of the equipments. No need of apostrophe.
Speaker B: Sorry.
Speaker A: No need of the apostrophe. No, no, no. Here equipment apostrophe is not required.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Equipments, yes, sorry. Equipment. That's all. Not as equipment. Equipment. Equipment itself is a plural number.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: So how many pages did you write? Can you go a little bit down?
Speaker B: It's only one page. It's only one page. This one.
Speaker A: Okay. No need itself, sorry. You at least made an effort to write even though after you came again. Are you back in Mumbai?
Speaker B: Yes, yes.

Speaker A: Okay, go a little up. Because right now I want to give you some basic aspects of articulation. So if we keep on checking this eat our whole coaching time. So why don't you. We will do one thing, I'll give you the basic concepts of articulation, okay? Okay. Take some time, include those concepts also and then rework on this seed document. That would be much better. That will be much discussion, right?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: And then go. After you prepare this document, go through it loud, read it twice or twice.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Now, as you can see, when I was loud reading it, there was that. You can make it out, right. So a change in sentence framing and all will be quite evident when you read it.
Speaker B: Yeah, sure.
Speaker A: You can stop the screen sharing quickly. We'll discuss about concepts of articulation.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: So three things are important when it comes to articulation.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: First is visualization. Second is specificity. These both go hand in hand. They complement each other. Okay. And third one is figures of speech. So visualization directly correlates to how we are framing a particular sentence.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Specificity directly correlates to what are the choice of words that we are selecting, but to a particular context.
Speaker B: Sorry.
Speaker A: Second one is how specificity correlates to how we are choosing the words. What are choice of words relevant to that particular context.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: Okay.

Speaker A: Third one, figures of speeches. How well are we able to craft the sentence? Okay, so many of us can frame a sentence, but some of the sentences, some of the paragraphs or some of the articles, they stand out because they innovatively craft the sentences. Okay, so this is where we use figures of speech. Okay.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: So to illustrate you with an example, I'll show one. I'll share one particular document with you and then we can do that. Are you able to see this?
Speaker B: Yes. Yes.
Speaker A: Can I read this particular line?
Speaker B: We were very poor when I was young. We had no clothes to wear, no toys to play, and no money to buy food.
Speaker A: Thank you. Now, can you read this one?
Speaker B: I was born in a stress sack in 1991.
Speaker A: Wretched sack.
Speaker B: Oh, Richard Sack. Yes. Riches sack in 1991. We had tinned roofs that allowed water to drift when it rained. My mother made me wear pale clothes with big holes in it. I played with a crushed ball all the day and steal food from roadside vendors.
Speaker A: Now, can you identify the difference between the first sentence and the second sentence? And what is the similarity between this first sentence and the second sentence? Read it again.
Speaker B: We were very poor when I was young. We had no process to wear, no toys to play, and no money to buy food.
Speaker A: Next, try this.
Speaker B: Basically, it's showing the childhood life, both the sentence similarities there is showing someone childhood life what, when he was born and what is the condition of the his family.
Speaker A: Exactly. So the similarity aspect between these two sentences is that when you read the first sentence, you find that the person who is talking talking is poor.
Speaker B: Yes.

Speaker A: Even when you read the second sentence also, you'll realize that the person who is talking is poor.
Speaker B: It's basically both are similar on the poverty level of this family.
Speaker A: The poverty is shown in both the sentences.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: But the intensity of the poverty is better showcased in the second sentence.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: This is where the visualization will come handy for you.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: So when you're able to better showcase it with visualization, they will connect with you.
Speaker B: They will connect, happens.
Speaker A: The understanding also happens or negotiations.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: So visualization and specificity complement each other. When you are more specific, you're able to create the visualization effect. Hence our output is better. Connect with your audience.
Speaker B: Thanks.
Speaker A: But how do we improve the specificity choice of words related to context? That is also important, right?
Speaker B: That is very much it.
Speaker A: Thesaurus word file may be.
Speaker B: Yes, yes.
Speaker A: I do it on the own.
Speaker B: Okay, let me check. I will do that.
Speaker A: Yeah. Anyway, so forget this, but whatever is there in word file, that is different. But I want you to check in the application format you to the source car but synonyms dictator synonyms.
Speaker B: Yes.

Speaker A: Right. So that is the basic approach of thesaurus. But right now it has become much more easier for you to understand and then relate it to context.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: You will have all the words, all the synonyms, yes.
Speaker A: But one thing that you have to observe is that these are all the synonyms that are most relevant. These are all the synonyms that are least relevant. Why these are given the most relevant because this is the context. The good one is it used in the context of pleasant and fine. These are all the relevant synonyms that you can use. Most relevant synonyms but when good is used in the context of moral and virtuous, your words change. When good is used in the context of competent and skilled, the words change. So yahpe tisaras website may they give different context for every word. Hare context may upna word case change of so this is how you can innovatively use the improve the word power.
Speaker B: Words talking power yes.
Speaker A: Yeah. Words be improved complex words simple words we use for context specific on achieve context yeah. So context specific alternate words you need to choose. So try to explore this thesaurus you find free time and then develop upon your existing reading habits and everything. Okay, now coming to the third point. Third point is about use of figures of speech.
Speaker B: Yes, yes.
Speaker A: Okay, those time pay instead of shuffling instead of, you know, getting jabi word yadni atana instead of showcasing that in emotions yadniya face may body language tamamara credibility so instead of that you can try and adapt yourself to express in a different way. This is where you. You can explore the figures of speech. So, yappa, figures of speech. The most relevant for our work life and our daily life are three things. The similarity based figures of speech, which is simile, metaphor and personification. These three, if you are able to. Metaphor itself, is a huge ocean. Metaphor sentences banasaktiya, so apnea sunai kali.
Speaker B: This personification I have heard, but simile and metaphor. I have.
Speaker A: I'll explain it to you in brief document upcoming. You can go in detail.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Document, concept and other things they discussed. Rest of all, for your future reference. You can read it.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: So he looks like a street pole. He's tall as a street pole. We are doing direct comparison. So comparison is a different way of conveying the message. Okay. You can say the machine is roaring like a lion.
Speaker B: Exactly.
Speaker A: Right. So it's like that. So direct compile usage of words like as.
Speaker B: Yeah.

Speaker A: Similarly, metaphor is indirect comparison. Here you try to do it for word, sentence, paragraph, story, poem altogether. But metaphor is used through example oriented or experience oriented. So, for example, Mumbai has become a concrete jungle.
Speaker B: Means it's a basically on the experience. It's basically on the experience oriented.
Speaker A: Let's say Mumbai has become a concrete jungle.
Speaker B: Basically, it's telling about the Mumbai.
Speaker A: Okay, what is it telling about Mumbai? Concrete jungle.
Speaker B: Sorry?
Speaker A: Concrete jungle.
Speaker B: Concrete jungle is basically. It's a machine life here. There is no such greeneries. It's a totally. Basically no such greeneries. Exactly.
Speaker A: It's filled with buildings. Densely constructed buildings everywhere.
Speaker B: Yes, yes.
Speaker A: You see me, right. To use creatively, concrete jungle. Boulder.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: But you are able to understand it, right? When I am saying concrete jungle, instead of saying it's densely populated area with closely knitted buildings, we are using one word, concrete jungle. That is a metaphor.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Okay. So this is how you can use explorer metaphor. So I. I would like you to stress on metaphor because that will be more usage for you in your line of work.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Especially during proposal. Proposal meeting. Okay. And third one is personification. Personification is also an indirect comparison. But here, the difference between metaphor and personification is we associate a non human entity to that of a human entity in personification.
Speaker B: No. So metaphor is for non human.
Speaker A: Nay, nay. Metaphor can be anything.
Speaker B: Can be anything.

Speaker A: General example, personification is specifically linking a non human entity to a human entity, for example.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Are a cruiser ship. Titanic. She looks magnificent.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Titanic, Lady Thorina.
Speaker B: No, no, no. Ship.
Speaker A: Right. Is a huge ship altogether. But we associate with she, see?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Because beautifulness where we are using personification.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Right. Next is a simple example. The flowers are dancing.
Speaker B: The flower is.
Speaker A: The flowers are dancing means it's shining.
Speaker B: It'S signing. And they are very much phrase, basically.
Speaker A: Dancing. Dancing, shining.
Speaker B: Okay. Yes, yes. Means shining and or it's basically moving on the yard.
Speaker A: Yes, yes. So that is what flowers are dancing means. So dancing is a human entity.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: But we are associating a non human entity like flowers to a human entity.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: That's a creative way of framing your sentences.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: So instead of saying that the flowers are just moving to the, you know, just fluttering to the wind, you say the flowers are dancing. You're picturizing your putting aesthetic element into it.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: You're beautifying the sentence. So this is the way you can try to reallocate your synthesis. You can typically in examples, experiences and opinions.
Speaker B: Okay.

Speaker A: Okay, so these are the three things that I wanted to explain to you. Visualization, specificity. Specifically baronically thesaurus. Third one is because of speech, how to craft your sentences innovative. So when you're able to craft your innovative sentences, you stand out.
Speaker B: Exactly. Then the visualization, then innovative. The new sentences.
Speaker A: Exactly. So these are the three things that are important for articulation. So may a document based on you try to go through it and then try to apply it to the existing document that you are preparing about negotiation. And then you send it to me one day prior so I can go through it and then.
Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. I will do that.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: Uh, next call I have to schedule. Let's see this. You have anything, uh, Saturday or Friday?
Speaker A: I have Saturday. You have Saturday. We can schedule it. Uh, 1030.
Speaker B: Let me check. I have also some internal meeting on Friday. Tomorrow you don't have anything.
Speaker A: Articulation concepts are just apply curve.
Speaker B: Then next, next week, I will put next next week.
Speaker A: Okay. So next week, uh,
Speaker B: So, okay, Monday, nine to ten, I can book.
Speaker A: Okay. Book 909:00 slot on Monday itself.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: And then send the document by Sunday evening.
Speaker B: Sure, sure.
Speaker A: Then we can discuss effects.
Speaker B: Yeah, sure.
Speaker A: Okay. And Monday Klea prepare for a mock presentation also.
Speaker B: Mock presentation? Yeah, I will do that.
Speaker A: Okay. So that you can cover both the elements okay we 1st 15 minutes will discuss the feedback and then doubts regarding the thinking and articulation yes second half of the 15 minutes we'll focus on your mock presentation okay okay so this is the agenda for Monday school okay sure don't forget to book it right away because kali java is there kali.
Speaker B: Nira no, I will book it right.
Speaker A: Away that would be great thank.
