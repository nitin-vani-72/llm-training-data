Speaker A: How are you finally?
Speaker B: Fine.
Speaker A: And how, how was the workshop experience?
Speaker B: It was good. Interesting. Also learn things.
Speaker A: So what was the concept that you felt these were really useful for you?
Speaker B: Actually, the activities, what we did, actually I have a fear in public speaking. So that was kind of.
Speaker A: So any. What practice was that related to public speaking or you felt you got a good stage to overcome that?
Speaker B: Yeah, because there were people and yeah, he was monitoring well and he gave some tips also, like using common words. We should avoid using those common words.
Speaker A: Like. So just to point out the same way you said, how was the workshop? Good and nice. Right? So we have to overcome that. Right? Tell me, how was it? The workshop? That's why asking you more questions. You tell me. It's good. It's night. It doesn't do anything for me.
Speaker B: It was effective before you.
Speaker A: Yes. So it was effective. Okay. So how, why do you think it was effective? Because were you able to apply some of these things in your work life?
Speaker B: Yes, because I have recently joined Lloyd. So while communicating with several things has changed when I communicate with them, using the words while interrupting me helped me a lot. Like this small thing which is said that was avoid using this common words in your sentence. Potential to those things and public speaking, as in we were supposed to prepare a presentation like hour, 15 minutes or an hour. So that give us like quick. We are. We got to learn that we can make something quickly if we have limited amount of time and how to make it effective. That thing was really nice.
Speaker A: And you, as you're telling me of public speaking, so do you have. So what, what happens? Why do you feel? What do you feel?
Speaker B: Because I've never done public speaking much. Maybe because of that I can practice. So first day in the training, I was like bitcoin nervous, but second day I was okay.
Speaker A: So as you feel, we have a chronic fear of the unknown. And so I was making your report. So I will send it to you by, I'm sure by this week or next week, I'll show. I'll send it to you.
Speaker B: Hmm.
Speaker A: We were able to express as a filly, but something that I saw was when you were speaking, you were rubbing your hands together, right. So that is a sign of nervousness. Yes. That was the first day. I guess that was the present. I saw the FGD presentation. That was the first one I should see in the final one. Final m one k presentation. Milani. Yeah. Did you give the final presentation on second day? I think the links have been not been updated. So report I made according to first one and I'll keep updating as we go along. All right, that's good. So overcoming that is good. And so I have my participants, which are actually sweaty palms, nervousness, and they can't even speak. So if you like that, I have some set of modules that can has really helped as well. So as a Nazi, during the workshop, we'll also discuss that. And probably, speaking of, definitely, I'm sure you will get more and more opportunities, right? So about your job role, can you give me a little brief on that?
Speaker B: I'm in a taxation department. In other than compliance, we have advisory and consulting consulting, and we meet every day. We have to talk with new people and meet different people. So here comes the communication skills where we have to improve, because every time we, every day we communicate with different people.
Speaker A: So when you're communicating with all of these people, is there some challenge that you face or that's if there are other, some things that you want to improve on.
Speaker B: Most important thing is when you speak, you should have something in the background, you should know about it. Only then you will be a good speaker. If you have no idea about the subject you are speaking about, then I think you won't be able to speak much and better and effective. So that is one thing. Before I go for communication, I try to prepare, I try to get a background of the thing, what I'm going to communicate over there. So this two thing, two, three things help me in the business. Communication. Before, I never thought about it. That the content is very important before I speak, but after that I have like realized, yes.
Speaker A: So when you say you felt content, Kautna Bharat, let's say. I will not say important, but let's say. So why did you feel that? So in your conversations, what did you focus on in general, like in the.
Speaker B: Presentation, which is with you?
Speaker A: Not just presentation. In your work, when you're meeting the clients, what are those conversations really around about the work?
Speaker B: Work only the taxation part, GST part, implications, some sort of advisory they are thinking about. So we tend to explain them about the case laws, present condition. What are the new notification and test series that has come up most of the time? Because of that, the conversation revolves around this topic, right?
Speaker A: So content is important, right? If you don't know the, what are the current regulations? If you not read your monthly magazine, right. You weren't even able to apply it, am I right? Yeah, that's good. And so in the workshop, was there any exercise related to using the mind map or concept of the golden circle was explained, was this anything related to that?
Speaker B: Yeah. Before making the presentation, he gave a roadmap. He said that I want presentation in this format and you have to work accordingly and the steps you should follow. So we have jotted down all the points and we're trying to prepare like the flow of presentation according to the process which he has. He has given. So, yeah, that was. We have.
Speaker A: Can you explain the steps that he mentioned?
Speaker B: Like we did. We brought some proposals for Deloitte. So one thing we did was what is the problem that is happening in that current particular sector and what Deloitte can do over there? And what is the. What is in it for Deloitte? Like what is Deloitte going to get back and then the roadmap and how we are going to achieve it? So one thing with that is that our presentation should be based on this following steps.
Speaker A: One is always setting the purpose. Am I right?
Speaker B: Yeah. What, why, when and what?
Speaker A: Why when? Tony Oga, I think what, why and how. So these three are very important elements, but there's also very some importance of sequence as well. Right. So if you see in some advertisements what the cell is the experience, right. Could be product of the sell the experience. So for example, if you remember Pepsi or Coca Cola, right? Pellet. Pellet.
Speaker B: Cheese.
Speaker A: Demarcation. When I said Pepsi or Coca Cola, what comes to mind?
Speaker B: Sorry, come again?
Speaker A: When I said Pepsi or Coca Cola, what is the first image that you get?
Speaker B: I think I was talking. I can regarding. About what? About the company or something generally the bottle, the one which we use.
Speaker A: The bottle which we use is blue. Yeah. Red. Whatever color that is there. You can almost hear it open, right. And the bubbling. You almost, almost saw that. Just the name. Right. So that also becomes a why they use it as a y element, right. They can. They can't say here some caffeinated sugar water. That is actual. What of carbonated drinks? Caffeine. Allah chemical, milaka kalapanikar. Yeah. Which you have a lot. So lots of sugar. Right. So actually it may. There will be 16 packets. 16 packets of sugar. Right. So that's not going to sell. So what, what are they trying to sell? The why factor. Why you should drink it. It's an amazing experience. Even if it's fake. That's how they're selling it. So that's a wrong example. So what's a good example? You've seen iPhone advertisements. They also show you the experience if you had an iPhone, how it would be different. Then they come to how. How they employ the best techniques, the best products best technologies from around the world. What is the new iPhone? Will ask me the sequence which I just said, telling people about why. Why are you selling this product? Or why should you, they listen to you? Or why am I doing. This is the first and core element. How you do it is about the process and last minute, basically. Kia. Kia, right? This is called a golden circle. Now, why do you call it a golden circle? Right? So this was a term coined by Mister Simon sinek. Alright, so what he said was, how do great leaders differ from how. How they do it and what they do? How do they differ? So he says, it's about these three questions. But this sequence is very important, what normal people do. I would, I would include that with me also. We tell about what and we tell about how and if you can turn on the video. Yeah, so I was talking about the golden circle, right? So what most of us do is when you're asked to explain something, let's say you're going to your client and explain what needs to be changed. It started. Yes. You start with the care. So what we, let's say you're going for a client meeting. And instead of just telling what needs to be solved, how, what if you started with why? Why some things need to be changed? Because I'm sure most of our conversations, after telling what needs to be changed, it's like make you Karu. Right? That is what normally the client says. We see a resistance in them, right? I don't want to change this. Why should I do it? All right. These are the kind of arguments we normally get, right? But what if you started with why? Okay, this is the amendment and this is why it needs to be done. So up. I suggest you don't tell. I suggest these are the changes that you should. That makes a lot of difference. Even if we don't hear it. They do hear it. If you just say. And he said, I suggest if you do, this will be according to change over. So they will not have it. So your purpose is that they make the changes and the utility is defined by you. You have to express how they find. Not everyone is going to find the utility by themselves. So this is a secret of the golden circle, right? Now we have to get out of the rut, right? We have to make sure that we apply this, right? Because when I also learn the golden circle, when I joined this organization, I realized a lot of things that I told were like, what you always what? And maybe we'll get to how. But why to Atai Neta, right? And this is what Simon Sinek says. I was also sending you the Ted talk that people are really interested in why you do things instead of what you do, right? I say I'm a coach. That is what TK. But if I tell you Hawaii, it all started why I'm interested in it, that's the story for another time. But if I tell that, that makes more sense to you, right? So instead of just knowing that I'm a take a coach. Fine, make a girl. If I tell you how I started and why I'm so much interested in that, that has even right now, you feel. Yeah. Why did you go into this line? Even for you into taxation by taxation, lots of other fields as you can go buy taxation. So there are a lot of questions which when you answer, has more importance and people, you can even tell them and you can sell yourself better, right? So first assignment, what I want you to do is need to tell me about your most memorable childhood memory. That in the next call. Not this one, next call Mapatana go. In the sequence of the golden sir so if you're telling me a story, telling me a memory, you tell me why first, there's a particular memory that I'm going to tell you. Why is it so important for you tell me how it happened. And then basically, Yahoo. What happened or what you felt or what happened to you, or what you overcame or whatever it is, I just want to get out of the. But another catch is that you send it to me in writing.
Speaker B: Okay?
Speaker A: Right. So that also acts as a sample which we can work on, right? What are the other mistakes that we have? All right, makes sense.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Technical issue the problem solve we may have email sent. I'll make sure I to send your report by this week. Free report. Thank you.
