Speaker A: Good morning, Ashuti. How are you?
Speaker B: I'm fine, sir. How are you, sir?
Speaker A: Good. Doing good. Thank you.
Speaker B: Thanks.
Speaker A: So I'm just opening up the.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: So yeah. Seems to the you had a lot of doubts in this particular shape.
Speaker B: No, sir. Single sentence, I don't have any. When it is some complicated type will come. I am confused that way. They left because if I made a very odd way, it will be very funny.
Speaker A: Exactly. At least, at least we'll get to know the funny side of it. But anyway. So, uh, were you able to go through that video and then try and understand what is all about the elements of Ode order?
Speaker B: No, sir. Actually I tried that. Uh, who, what, when, um, what, when, where, who, art, where, when, uh, how and why.
Speaker A: So were you able to understand the correlation of these six elements with the word order and the copt there actually one single sentence.
Speaker B: If you given I can somehow construct in a proper order. But some element, some of the sentence I missed out here that I am getting kind of complication. For example, in that one sentence is there my family went to Wall street or something like that. So when I started know who is. So I started Disney something. I started like then I two, three times I tried and sentenced like that.
Speaker A: Okay, so the reason why I gave you this sheet is. So this sheet consists of various difficulties. So when there are simple sentences, they directly correlate to this ideal word order. Right. As you keep on, the thing that you want to, I want you to understand from the video is that whatever the word order is given for you, who, what, where, when, how and why, this is an ideal word order. But this doesn't mean that every time this, the order needs to be in this particular pattern. So we try to create sentences. When we try to create sentences with this ideal word order, it becomes very easy. So typically we need to use this word order in email communication. Okay. So when you first frame any sentence with this kind of word order, your line will be emotionally neutral. The sentences are emotionally neutral and they are very formal as well. Okay. So just to give you an example, I'll just show you before we discuss. Okay, so this was the, if you see sample one here, this is a original email that the person has sent.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: So below, items are high value and there is no sales in the last five months. Please reconfirm once again to process ahead. Misses swaminathan, please give your inputs on the same. This is the main thing that you think after introduction of word order. This is what, how things have changed in a more precise way. I am writing with respect to the chart, I believe that the requester items are of high value and there hasn't been any recorded sales for the last five months. Finally, reconfirm these items, as it might take a toll on the inventory requesting this honor. So you see, the starting sentences, all are in the perfect word order. They always start with the subject. They just what is the action happening? And then why exactly it is happening? Everything has a logical explanation towards it. So if you read this particular paragraph, there's nothing emotionally reverting out of this particular thing, right? So it sounds formal and then it is complete. There's no need for any sort of asking double questions again, right? So board order is the ideal order is more practiced in the email communication. So as you keep on practicing this, your speaking also will be more formal, but on an informal scale, things might change. Yeah, we'll discuss about that. So why that is happening? Because simple word, ideal word order, it is easier to frame, but as we go and then interchange the sentences or, you know, bring in some complications, we need to adjust this by exploring the rules of grammar, like articles, prepositions, adverbs and adjectives. All of these things come into picture. Okay, so we'll go one by one and then discuss the sheet that you have sent, so that you will also get the clarification. First one, you left it. I drank a bottle of water after that. So I drank a bottle of water is fine. So who is the subject? I drank is the verb. What did you drink? Bottle of water is the object. Okay, who and what are completed then? Is there mentioned place mentioned?
Speaker B: No.
Speaker A: No. Right. So what is next? When rightly, go for when. When did you drink the bottle of water?
Speaker B: When I. In morning. I drank the water. So morning I have to mention.
Speaker A: Right, so. But you did not do anything in the morning. So there is one more action combined with the time here.
Speaker B: Okay, okay. Okay.
Speaker A: When I ran this morning, right, so.
Speaker B: Activity is connected to that. We. We have to correlate.
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: I mean, I confuse an exhibition where should come where it's not there. Ran in this morning, I could confuse.
Speaker A: So a little bit of. Logically, you have to put your mind into it. You cannot just. It doesn't mean that, you know, only time means time needs to be there. It can be common. That's what I'm saying. Little bit of understanding needs to be done here. If we learn in that particular format, then it will. It's very hard to adapt the language. And the second one has a small change. David made all the food for the party.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Okay. About cookies for everyone. So here also if you see, you started with one element.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Okay. So thing is that when you start with one element, when I was younger, then you have to put a comma here. Then the sentence become unnatural.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: So unless and until is necessary, we should not write like this. So when you have an easy chance to make a single sentence, why not do it? So you put the in the reverse format.
Speaker B: Okay. Okay.
Speaker A: Single sentence natural.
Speaker B: Portion of the video.
Speaker A: Yes. Last portion of the video says that.
Speaker B: We give the reason. If you are starting other than who we have to give the reason. So I thought it may be like that. That is why constructed like that.
Speaker A: Yeah. But here there is no reason, right.
Speaker B: Okay. Okay. Okay. Understood. Understood.
Speaker A: Yeah. When I was younger, I used to ski, but now I'm older, I don't ski anymore. When you do a sentence like this, then you can do it.
Speaker B: Oh, okay.
Speaker A: Now.
Speaker B: Understood.
Speaker A: Yeah. They change the sentences also in the video if you observe.
Speaker B: Okay, I understood. Understood. Because a valid reason should be there. It's maybe a routine activities machine. Okay. Okay.
Speaker A: I want to go on a vacation. What items we buy at Walmart. I want to live a long and happy life. Sandra. I work at six this morning. At six this morning? At 06:00 this morning completed. Okay. 9th one doctor.
Speaker B: I put. I tried to construct if it is wrong. No, it will be very funny. So I probably.
Speaker A: The first session.
Speaker B: So actually it should come first. I. I or my. I. Uh. What should come? I got confused.
Speaker A: Okay. So there are two subjects here. Let's try with first one. I. What would be the next sentence?
Speaker B: What? What? Yeah, I need to. Or I see to. I don't know.
Speaker A: I need to.
Speaker B: See doctor.
Speaker A: No, no, no, the doctor.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: About my arm. Done.
Speaker B: Okay. I need to see my. I need to see the doctor about my arm. Okay.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: Okay, sir. Okay, so I confused because I also there. My also there. Which one is come first?
Speaker A: Simple. Uh, you have, uh, full stop after arm. I is in caps. My is not in caps.
Speaker B: Not that much. Now I'm not observed at how I. I got one tactic in that.
Speaker A: That's why I made it very simple enough for you to follow.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Right. So Walmart also has question mark. So you know that Walmart will come towards the end. You try to frame sentences like that. Right? I need to buy the food. Change. To buy some food for small change. Buy some food for the dog. I want to learn to speak in English. There is no in. No, you don't need to put a word.
Speaker B: No.
Speaker A: This is correct. I want to learn to speak English.
Speaker B: Twelve one.
Speaker A: Yes. Twelve one. Now you only try.
Speaker B: I. I had to go to class because I left early. Because I had to go to class.
Speaker A: Done.
Speaker B: I left.
Speaker A: I left work early.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Simple enough. Or you can say I left class early because I had to go to work. Anything?
Speaker B: Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Third one is 13. Eyes. Maria.
Speaker A: What happened to Maria?
Speaker B: Maria. Maria was. Sorry. Actually, Maria should come first. Next. Aspirin. What?
Speaker A: What happened to Maria? Here. What is the verb mentioned in the whole session? Got what?
Speaker B: Maria. Virus. Stomach issue. Some virus when she was in Mexico.
Speaker A: Exactly. She got her Mexico.
Speaker B: Mexico.
Speaker A: Simple enough. Now you're able to make it, right? Next. What grocery did he buy at the store? What did he buy at the grocery store? Grocery store is your place, right?
Speaker B: Oh, yes. So where it should come in where? Category? Okay, okay.
Speaker A: Okay. Sammy drew a picture of his house. Fine. I saw them in the. In park. I saw them walking in the park. You should actually pay more attention to the words that are given to you. You're missing out something. Words. That's why you're not able to form them. So utilize all the words that are given to you. Then it will be much more clear. Little powers of observation.
Speaker B: Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Speaker A: Find a job. I need to have my teeth checked. Not tooth. I want to buy a new car. This is little bit different. Would you like to try now? 20th one. It is similar to four.
Speaker B: When I.
Speaker A: No, no, no.
Speaker B: Here. It should start with when.
Speaker A: No, always start with subject, irrespective of it.
Speaker B: Okay. I often travel to. I often.
Speaker A: Take help from the sentence four.
Speaker B: I used to sky when I was younger. And I often use money when. When I had to travel.
Speaker A: I used to travel often when I had money.
Speaker B: Okay, okay.
Speaker A: I want to go to the mountains. Correct. Hmm. Come on. 22nd. Who is the subject?
Speaker B: Carlos.
Speaker A: Yeah. What is.
Speaker B: Paid? His card.
Speaker A: Paid. What did he pay?
Speaker B: Debit.
Speaker A: I mean, for what did he pay? What is the object?
Speaker B: Object.
Speaker A: You pay for something, right? What is that? What did he pay for?
Speaker B: Debit. With his gas card.
Speaker A: No, there's no gas card. Gas means fuel only.
Speaker B: Okay. Debit card. Actually. Sorry. Debit card. Right. So to say.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: Carlos. No, no.
Speaker A: What's the screen? What's the screen? Complete the sentence. Now. Carlos paid for his gas.
Speaker B: With his debit card.
Speaker A: Yes. Simple enough.
Speaker B: Okay, okay, okay.
Speaker A: So object is gas. So in us they say no, gas. Instead of petrol, we say petrol.
Speaker B: Okay, okay.
Speaker A: Family flew to Disney world.
Speaker B: Actually, subject. No, I initially. What? I started with Disney like that. Then I corrected the sentence.
Speaker A: After trying to pretend correct only whatever you have written is correct.
Speaker B: Actually I framed faster.
Speaker A: Martha drove her children to school that is also correct. I used to work long hours before I got sick. Nice. I ate early this morning because I am hungry again so when you are saying I ate early this morning because you were hungry right?
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Then it should come because I was hungry but we don't have was here right? So always put the effect first then give the cause okay okay what is the effect? Right now you are hungry right? Whenever there is because you always put the effect first and then the cause.
Speaker B: So reason should come 2nd. 1st we have to give the current condition like that way I am hungry because like that exact I should give second exactly.
Speaker A: So whenever there is because always the reason follows right? Like that. So you are hungry right now why? Because you ate early this morning even though here also you're trying to portray the same thing. It would be correct if instead of am was was given.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: I ate early this morning because I was hungry. Okay okay you can say like that everything is in the past but right now it is different I am hungry. Something is there in the present. Okay I need to talk there's one more two again powers of observation I need to talk to my daughter's teacher 28.
Speaker B: Here I should come first. I used to eat spicy food before.
Speaker A: Okay I gave you some clue extended. I used to eat spicy food before my stomach come on. Come on.
Speaker B: My stomach began.
Speaker A: There's only three more words. Come on. Someone began to bother me okay use the same logic and then answer the 29.
Speaker B: I used to. I used to work.
Speaker A: Where you used to work? What is the place?
Speaker B: Office.
Speaker A: In an office when?
Speaker B: Before my baby.
Speaker A: I had my baby so you used to work in an office? Yeah small change in the last norma came I came to the office late okay. When element time comes towards the end that is actually so people often even though many people say that I came late to the office today we went late to the meeting but the correct word is I went meet I went to the meeting late okay. You know Norma came to the party late okay anyway so how was exercise overall?
Speaker B: I saw that video two times. Once I saw the video I tried halfway then again I saw one more time then this I feel that but actually I was trying but I thought if it is very odd it will funny way only it will happen so I left it like this.
Speaker A: Most of your guesses are correct so most of your guesses are one thing you need to understand ashworthi that even we discussed in the first session that don't think what others will think. Okay? There is too much sound coming on though. Hello. Hello. Like I said, learning needs to be done without judging. Please. I understand. But please get out of that mindset. Even though if it is something wrong and funny, let it be, accept it and then we can improve upon it.
Speaker B: Okay? Okay.
Speaker A: Okay. Anyway, it is me, a third person who doesn't know. So I'm coaching without judging. So I expect you to reciprocate yourself without judging.
Speaker B: Okay? Okay.
Speaker A: Okay. So three, be happy. We chill. Even though it you, let's laugh on it, you know? Let's learn from it. It's fine. Okay. So this, I'll share you this worksheet. You can go through it once again. Apart from this, I'll share you one online link as well for you to practice more regarding this word order. So it will be easier. So it has various levels. So you can try from the basic level and then slowly graduate it to different levels and complex sentences. So that will help you out in framing this word order. And also you can apply this word order to your emails. So take some couple of emails from your past and then try to extract the elements. So see whether everything is arranged in that particular word order or not. What are the elements that I have written and then try to reframe it.
Speaker B: Okay, sir. One. I'm quoting here. One usually when after one call we are referencing. So used to ensure as discussed, please find the attached documents for your references. So if I am reconstructing, reconstructing as discussed, I am attaching some documents for your reference. Should come like that.
Speaker A: Exactly. I am rejecting the document for your reference.
Speaker B: Okay. Okay.
Speaker A: So that would be. And then furthermore, we can see some of the bigger emails. Try to isolate the sentence first, the word order and then apply it and then reframe it and see. Compare and see which one sounds better, which one sounds more formal. Get a clear idea about your emails as well. Okay. This is something that you can do. So I follow up with the online exercises and then I can go for this email. And I hope you are practicing loud reading.
Speaker B: Yeah. Yes, sir. Previously I am practicing because mindfulness. I read one time and I taken one small book of sudha mukti. It's a kids book only that I started reading loudly. Half of the book is over. Some words are not knowing to me. So I am checking meaning and then I am going half. I finished a like that reading loudly every day.
Speaker A: Great. So please keep training your voice. And apart from this you have. I can suggest you one app called Elsa speak.
Speaker B: Elsa.
Speaker A: Elsa. Note it down.
Speaker B: Okay. Elsa speak. Okay. Okay.
Speaker A: So they'll give you immediate analysis about reading. So they can start with. They'll give you short paragraphs. So it's a pronunciation app. So they'll give you how we are reading it. Pace, stress, everything. They'll give you a little bit of analysis.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: So you can try out this app as well. So apart from this, I'll be forwarding some basic grammar videos, articles, propositions, adverbs and adjectives and tenses. So you can watch. You can start off with articles or propositions for now. Okay. And then we can discuss the same in our next session. Try to apply those things on exercises. Okay, so we'll spend more time on exercises in the sessions. So I expect you to go through the videos, try and understand, and then give me what did you learn and what are your doubts? So, for the initial five to ten minutes, we can discuss what did you learn from those videos and what are the doubts you have. And then for the next 2030 minutes, we will discuss that we'll apply on exercises so that the easier for us to understand. Okay. So we will get the basics done in the first few sessions, and then we'll focus on applying more in the next four sessions. Okay, so, any queries for today?
Speaker B: No, sir. Actually, this is only one. For some leftover sentences only. My confusion, how to frame it. Right.
Speaker A: Most of your guesses are correct only. But you're. You're only not confident enough to try out various formats. So you can try different. Different sentences, see which is making more sense. Don't stop at one and then say that it might not. It might sound funny. Try different combinations of words.
Speaker B: Okay. Okay.
Speaker A: Okay. You just need to go deeper. You have the logic with you?
Speaker B: Okay? Okay. Sure.
Speaker A: Okay. Be more confident. Thank you for your time, Ashruti. It was great talking to you. Have a nice day.
Speaker B: Thank you, sir. Same to you. Have a nice weekend.
