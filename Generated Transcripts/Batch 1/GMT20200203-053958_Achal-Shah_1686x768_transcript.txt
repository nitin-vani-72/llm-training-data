Speaker A: Hi, Sheetal. Sheetal, can you hear me?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Bought dark image. Why is that, sir? Sheetal, how was the workshop? Third workshop, Kesara third workshop was great.
Speaker B: I mean, if I compared with the other ones now, then the last one was awesome. Okay, so I enjoyed a lot. That actually last one I enjoyed a lot. I think the way she was conducting, she conduct that session there was a great. I mean, we all involved in that. I mean, awesome experience.
Speaker A: Okay, so what were the learnings? Pratishta is a good, very good coach. But what are your learnings from that?
Speaker B: Teamwork and the coordination between the team. And if you want to tell someone something. So instruction. What? Whatever instruction you gave to the someone now should be the. Should be under. Should be understandable to the other people.
Speaker A: Very true. How do we make sure of that? Whatever you're saying can be really understood. We understand perfectly by someone. How do we make sure of that?
Speaker B: Just look from that a person's perspective. If you look from that person, the other person's perspective now. So we can give a simple instruction. And the most important, the most important part of the team is trust. Mutual trust. We need a mutual trust for to form a team. If you don't have a trust now, then you cannot work as a team.
Speaker A: Very true. If you cannot keep it only transactional in a team, you need to be together. That's the only way you will actually work together. And so if there's a problem, right. And you set the bar, the senior manager, these are just the executives. So even if the manager is committing all blunder, the executors are not going to say it because we don't have trust. We don't have that open connection with the manager. And eventually your team will fail. Right. Because the manager was not open to suggestions. Right. So they will definitely take that.
Speaker B: Right.
Speaker A: So now for getting a someone's perception is not always very easy to do, right? But that is something that, as you said, can. Now, you found it to be very interesting, right? And I hope that you start at least take someone now. Also, the heart takes assumptions as well as one more thing very dangerous about assumptions is when we take the wrong ones.
Speaker B: Right?
Speaker A: Right. So while you are giving instructions, try to gauge the audience, right. Let's say you assume, uh. So let's say you're talking to me and you assume I know everything that went in the workshop. What if Pratish says not transferred the session plan with me, right? So maybe I don't know what went in the workshop, right? Or now also have contacted three, four other people. Everyone has a different view of the workshop, right. While you mentioned team, a lot of other people explained about word tree and the vocabulary building activities over there. Some were still stuck on presentation may role play. Role was very effective. Right. So you see, workshop car is very unique. No one has repeated their feedbacks. Repeat who I need. Everyone has their own perception. Everyone has their own way of looking at the workshop and their takeaways. So Apka, sub important takeaway workshops. The one thing that is, it was teamwork. Other than your concepts. Concept. Concept. Can you give me a brief on it?
Speaker B: Yes. Uh, she told us about, uh, how to remember these words and the vocabulary, obviously. And, uh, she told us about that, uh, word three.
Speaker A: Word three.
Speaker B: She suggest us a one website. Lexico.
Speaker A: Lexico, yes.
Speaker B: And she told us about to avoid good, very lazy words.
Speaker A: But that doesn't mean you say it was awesome. Right. So that, that is the resistance that we have. So we know that we should not use good, nice or even if very good. Right. Or some things are very using this. We still do use it because we haven't found a substitute to it yet. Right. That is our gap. Right. And to bridge the gap, we need to start learning. We need to start developing our vocabulary. As we have discussed in last two calls as well, vocabulary have developed. Karogita, usko up, utilize karpawe. So I think pratista set the stage of why you should do this. Am I right? Should we use better words like instead of good? You said, let's say the workshop was very enriching. Others are the great learning experience. Or there was. So there's a different ways of. You can see it with how. So, as I said, every participant in a different perspective. So every participant can use another word. Right. Domna Bhatta. I think we even talked about reading, developing, reading active. And we did svo p word order on the first session. Thinking in English, impromptu present playback isolate. Right. We discussed articles also last time. Right. We are making mistakes. More on articles. Right. So that's good. So do you feel in this time, because there was a gap between the third workshop and our coaching calls. So tell me about some of the practices that you're still doing and which are practices you should get. Hello.
Speaker B: Yes, sir. Just two days back, we had one team, one training in our department. So I participated in and I coordinate with the organizers. So I think it was, that was the great, that was a good experience for me, that I start interacting with the people and I take init. I took the initiative for the first time, I think for the first time here. So it was good for my con. For my. For me to bring my confidence up.
Speaker A: Mm hmm. That's great. That's really good. That's not good. That's very.
Speaker B: I am still saying that. Good word.
Speaker A: Right. So that was. You took up opportunities. Right? So you took up courage. That was very courageous. You could say, uh, that was. So how did it feel to take and take up responsibility? How did that make you feel today?
Speaker B: When I took. Not the first time, I thought, no, I can't do this. It was. And it is so difficult for me to handle all the things, but once I started doing them, the. All the teammates and my colleagues helped me. So I even didn't realize that, no, it's just a small thing I can do. Even I can do better than this, and I. I think I did better.
Speaker A: That's encouragement helps. Right. So that's all. That is why you are also saying that is when you learn teamwork. So when you were down or you felt you are not confident, your team came up and said, yeah, you can do this. Let's do this together, rather than you leading it, they said, let's do this together. Am I right?
Speaker B: Yes. Yes.
Speaker A: And that made all the difference. That's perfect. Right? And so reading habits.
Speaker B: Reading habits.
Speaker A: Okay, so what are you reading currently?
Speaker B: Abhibhayab. They have Abdul Kalam's book.
Speaker A: Which one? Wings of Kanantha.
Speaker B: Yes. Wings of the fire.
Speaker A: Wings of. Wings of fire.
Speaker B: Wings of fire. Yes. Yes.
Speaker A: I do have it in my small library that I have. That reminds me. Yes, that's a good idea. I think I wanted to read that. So I will take that. So, okay, what does Abdul Kalam say in that book?
Speaker B: If you can articulate that is explaining all his life experience and how he reached to that point, how he become the scientist and we encourage him all these life story.
Speaker A: So how. How much through the book are you. How much. How much time will it take to read? Read it. Completely completed.
Speaker B: Huh?
Speaker A: Complete.
Speaker B: Half. Almost half.
Speaker A: So this is a good activity. What I was thinking was, though. So Abhitak juice life experiences. So what do you think can be takeaways from that? I want you to write something on that.
Speaker B: Write something now?
Speaker A: No, not now. So by the next call, I want you to write on it. Right. And if you can complete the book by then, that's even better. Right? So that also gives you more incentive to complete the book because you have to write on it. Right. So. So that book was Abdul Kalam about Abdul Kalam, right now you are reading it from your perspective and there are some insights that there are a few things. Okay. But this is something that I really like. There are. Right throughout, when you are reading, there are some things are hard. This is like, this is very inspirational. But there are a few things you realize. This is something that I want to implement in my life when you reading someone's biography. So we might not connect with everything you might feel, but there's something. Yes. I have to apply this one in my life. Am I right?
Speaker B: Right.
Speaker A: So after reading the book, so I want you to write on your key learnings, what your key learnings or what your takeaway would be. What would you like to implement from Abdul Kalam's life in your own right? And you just. No need to mention you. I want to. I want you to explore why do you feel that is this particular trade that I want to, you know, implement in my life that will be in depth reading? In depth reading, in depth writing and thinking and structuring. So Maribosa sub charge our capability.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: And what I will do is I will also try and see if I. I think I have the book. I find it. And I also try to complete in one week or so. It's not very both Balambani, you know, I'll try to complete that book.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: So that is. That should be interesting, right?
Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. So I will write all the key points that I wanted to implement in my life. So I will write it down. I will show you.
Speaker A: Yeah. So you can present only in the next. Next call itself that kiss me learning cursor. That's why you have to write it at least two pages minimum or two pages. You have to write it in the word format.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Okay. You send it. You have to send it to me. Don't change the font size so that you have to write less. Okay.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: So, okay, so what else? So PD thumbnail. So it's also in terms of speaking. Right. So are you getting more opportunity to speak? Are you doing thinking in English?
Speaker B: Yes, sir. I think I'm getting, uh. Now I'm getting the chances to speak to others. So I'm just taking it all the opportunities that I have.
Speaker A: Opportunities that. Hello.
Speaker B: I am getting the opportunities to pick my senior and the others, especially with the Navy person. I am taking this. So I am taking this.
Speaker A: So good. So I think that the Navy personnel's English would be very polished, right?
Speaker B: Actually.
Speaker A: So that would be. That would be a good opportunity. So even initially, as I said, if you make mistakes. It's okay, you're learning, right? But we need to keep doing it. If you stop doing it, then we will never go. We're now going to improve, right? So if the same, if I as a coach, I want to improve my delivery in the workshops and I will do more workshops and I have to take in. I have to introspect every time that. So this is something we do, something that I do. So if I'm taking a session, if there is a co facilitator, either they record me, right? So I take a recording of myself in the next week, I study it. Okay. What are the things that I need to improve on and take feedback from them. The same way when you're speaking, if you have a friend somewhere in this, maybe in the same room, or when you're having a conversation, take feedback. Can you identify some mistakes or what do you feel? How can I improve on it?
Speaker B: I can do one thing, actually, what I will write now. So I will try to speak and then I will record myself and I will see what I am doing and what I am suggest that how many mistakes I am doing this it is a better idea, I think, to see yourself.
Speaker A: So that way you're not dependent on anyone, right?
Speaker B: You can even not feel you that it will not feel that embarrassing with someone. If you do the mistakes you will do. If you will do. You are doing the mistakes in front of you. It is. No, it just. You are only me and myself.
Speaker A: Carlos. Yes, because yes. You know the concept right? Now. PT articles ki so you realize what your mistakes are, right? In terms of grammar, at least in terms of grammar, am I right? So you keep isolating one thing at a time, like particularly articles, other, we just focus on articles because other. And now we try to see how can we use more strong verbs and words, right? So, yeah, this writing also will help you because you're trying to articulate your thoughts onto paper. Like so when you are writing it down. Apa, got a good bad news, like just right. Okay, good bad. So now let's say you think I find this particular trait of Abdul kalam. Good, right? That is what we say. So ask yourself why what does this particular trait reflect about Abdul kalam? Right? So let's say. Let's say, for example. So I don't know, I'm just giving an example. Let's say he doesn't give up. He doesn't give up. He keeps trying and trying. And it tries to do something regularly. So what is one word for that? Whatever obstacles come to you you still are going to do it, right? No matter what. So what is the word? Word for it? Try to search for it, right? So that one word for that is perseverance, right? That is called perseverance. So first you have to when? Now, when? But you know it, right? So then you try to search for it, right? So here you find out the word that is. That is perseverance. Doing something despite difficulty or delay in achieving the success, right? So google to hey, nito lexico b upco di lexico can also help this, right? Dot in ta.com kia dot co, the lexico.com dot. You can always use this to find different words. There are also one more website as well which I use. Lexicoto. Hey, dictionary, cable, user thesaurus. Let's say hard work. Hard work. Let's do that. So if you want more more words, I have one more website called word hippo. Okay, so verdipo, what it does is the same thing as lexico but it gives you more words. Bahadi Zadava, what's another word for, let's say hard working. Okay. Hard working maker. And I'm fine trying to find it. So now with the context words like just ending religions and commitment, committed, dedicated is also one word that you can use. I was very committed to this book. Right then. Hello. Yeah. Then having a showing ambition and a willingness to work to. So this is something that you are trying to say, am I right? Unwavering, untiring tennis goal oriented, self driven initiative and resourcefulness. You can use word approved to find similar words like this as well.
Speaker B: Okay sir.
Speaker A: Right. So if you keep questioning yourself, why then you will able to understand. Okay, good. And then you will able to use. Now when it comes into writing, slowly it will translate to our sentences when we are speaking. All right.
Speaker B: Yes, yes.
Speaker A: All okay.
Speaker B: Okay. I will try this.
Speaker A: Yeah. So, right. And try to see some dead. It always helps the option in which you can topics, right? So you can check what makes sense to you like your Ted.com hair. I want you to do reading habit. Also teds are a wonderful place where you can load on load, right? So as well you can see how people are presenting their ideas. Now that you are in a communication program, you realize, but how is it different? So you can always see the topics range from anything, bacteria, bionics, big problems, china, Christianity, communication, right? Let's say the communication layer. Communication will be in terms of lots of other things. It also must be about language, right? How can you support emotional well being of teachers? How changing your story can change your life, it's about communication. So this must be about storytelling, right? Stumbling towards intimacy. What? Reading slowly taught me about writing. So this is a very good insights which help you to write better. You'll see how they are articulating it, right? So for this week, up next week of call book, what I want is really work on your reading of Abdul Kalam's book, extracting what you really like. And I want to see how you articulate it, right? So maybe in the next workshop you can use this to present it. So we can do that. But this time you strong word, because you're prepared, getting so much time to prepare, right? If you want to add a story, add a story from the book. You can do that. But don't make it to make sure that it's not too long as well.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: I guess another dope is one and a half a story per. Though I know how we write our exam papers, engineering. So yeah, we are not going to do that.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: This would be a good opportunity. So first, what you do, write what comes to your mind, right? It will not. It might not be in order, it might not be in structure, but that's what it's in your thoughts. So write it down. Then when you written it down, read it aloud. When you read it aloud, as if you are, so they will get a perception of someone who's actually hearing it. Then you will know what changes to make audience perception change. We just read it aloud. When you return it or take a five minute, ten minute break and then read it, that's. You'll understand. Then you will know what changes to be made. All right, I want to rigorously work on that and present it in the next call. The next call. Jabbi booker Oskar.
Speaker B: Okay, sir. All right, thank you. Bye bye. Yes, sir.
Speaker A: Okay, bye.
