Speaker A: Can I watch laptop for some more time? I said no, you had to finish your homework.
Speaker B: So that would be a different scenario, right? That was something that he she wishes, right? That is not an exactly an objection. So work, maybe. So you deal with. You would deal with it to clients or even business, as you call, right. Business partners, correct. Business partners as well. So any kind of objection that you remember from that.
Speaker A: Okay, so generally, whatever requirement comes to us, technically, we had to see if technically it is feasible or not, because their requirement is correct at their point, because they want it. But if technically is not possible, we will provide an option that, okay, this is something you want, but it is not technically possible, but this is what we can do it. So we will.
Speaker B: So now in this time, just stopping there. So if in this typical example, I said this, I want an x feature, feature number x. You said, nayota, you ended the conversation there, but you never got to know what the client really wanted. It was only after asking few times, they're really serious about it, that they will. But this is what I wanted. That is where I was saying feature x. Is there something else possible that happens very less. But when you say this is a feature x that they want. Right. Let's say, can you give me one more, some typical example, if I can help you.
Speaker A: For example, they want to have, technically, I can say they want to have some XYZ feature in the output. For example, if I want, they want to edit some field. And whenever this put the save button, it has to validate and it has to save it in the backend like database table.
Speaker B: So, abner, you say it's not possible, okay? And so, as you can say, so I understand that you want to validate the entries that happen here, but it is not possible at this junction. So where do you want to use the data? Or where else can you validate this? Or is this, what exactly do you want to do? What is the alto? Or what is the goal that you want to achieve so that I can look into the feasible functions that we can provide? Would that actually add more value to that conversation?
Speaker A: Yes. So first of all, we have to understand what their requirement is, and then we have to validate whether it is a good to have feature or need to have feature. So technically we will validate that thing. Like whether it is just for example, if we have a report where we have a one button, f one press, they want to have pop up. There is one requirement where they want to display data in table manner, but technically, to achieve that, it was very difficult for us. Then we said that, okay, this is something which is just good to have feature aesthetically, huh? Right. F one help user can see a normal text also that we can. But you want us to give an example in a table manner with the border like Excel make a table. So that was not possible for technically. Then we done R and D and lot of things we did and we then able to display as a table. But borders are not there, which are not possible for us. So we said that we cannot do it as a defect because this is something which is good to have feature and we cannot, you cannot raise it. This has a defect. Technically this is not possible.
Speaker B: So in this conversation, unko table make you chiheta.
Speaker A: They just want to see if.
Speaker B: The response that you're saying they just wanted for aesthetic. Did they tell you or are you inferring that?
Speaker A: No, no. They asked me to put the information in table manner.
Speaker B: Great, agree. They told you to put it in a table tabular manner. But I'm saying why did they want it in a tabular manner?
Speaker A: Just to have good to have feature.
Speaker B: Like is that your statement or their statement?
Speaker A: Their statement. Because see this is something just to display to the user, right?
Speaker B: But the thing to learn we are going in a little two to three direction. So my point was given manner machine, right? And you know it's not possible, right? So interesting in nah. So what you want to know is what do they really want to achieve, right? Because it can also happen because you are the some, you are the point of contact for that person who knows what can be done. What is not done cannot be for them. They know, okay, this is, this is what they want. You are, you are the bridge. But if you say, right, so maybe there was another feature that not in this situation, just that I want you to have that kind of conversation where, okay, okay, I understand that you want to display it in a tabular format, can understand what is the reason behind it or what are the thought process behind it. Then they can say this is what you want. And if it is in a table, we can maybe have the dates or whatever that output is very easy for us to compare. Then you have your answer. Okay, this is what you want. Instead of pop up. This is what I can give you. Is that. Will that work? Maybe I can send it in an email.
Speaker A: Yeah. So this kind of conversation will always happen because I am into always in solution discussion. So what can be done? What cannot be done? That decision or designing part is like taken care by my level. And then once I decide, okay, this can be achieved, then I will give it to the, they will write it into the functional specification and then we will give it for development.
Speaker B: I understand. I understand the process completely. I'm just have saying examples. Right. I just wanted to paraphrase instead of saying bluntly, no. Right. Because when, no, we didn't really understand the need.
Speaker A: No.
Speaker B: Even if it was simply. I'm not picking, I'm not really picking at that. I'm saying you are wrong in that situation.
Speaker A: Yeah. So 90% of the time what we say that, okay, I understand the requirement. Let me check if technically possible or not. We always keep this. Note that, okay, let me check and come back on this point, whether it is technically achievable or not.
Speaker B: Still there is something that you're missing over there. You're saying, I will let you know, but try to understand why do they want it? That will let you know what do they really want?
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: They cannot understand it at your level. Right. Because you're the one who's like in the back end and knows all the codes and processes. Right. They look at this is what I want.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: Right. And they would have a thought process behind it because this is what becomes easy for me. So if you understand that process, maybe you will be able to tell three features that they would not have thought about.
Speaker A: Okay, great. Oh, what we say in that case that try to think from end user prospective what exactly their requirement is.
Speaker B: Correct. And now, so if you go back to those objective handicra, most of the time you are even doing that. Right. Now charges that the persuasion may, we came to these four things that helps us to, or even aids us for in persuasion. First is building your credibility.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: Right. So without a credibility, you are not going to ever trust someone, is it? Right. So what is a credibility? Credibility comes from trust. How do you trust someone?
Speaker A: With my experience.
Speaker B: Hello.
Speaker A: Hello. I'm able to, yes.
Speaker B: So how would you normally trust someone? Correct.
Speaker A: With my experience.
Speaker B: Right. Experience agar hair. So you know he's in, let's say veteran or is an experienced person. So they would trust them. Now, let's say you're meeting them for the first time. You don't know how much experience they have. Not, they have not talked about it. You'd ask a few questions. You see in how much in depth they answer to that question.
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: Once is knowledge. Second is the experience that they have that they have shown. So credibility becomes one factor, one important factor for persuasion. So if you're, and if you feel so, watch for these three to four factors due to which you can feel that opposite person is not really believing you. If it feels I'm not too sure or something to paraphrasing, asking these questions will eventually tell. I have not tried this, so I don't know. Then you can say this is from, for example, if these are XYZ or lesser, 20. These are 20 projects is similar to the ones that I work. This is the feature that we have applied and this is why we have done it. That instantly sets your credibility and makes them trust you more. This is something which is already been done. So that is one. Right. So setting the credibility, carry articulating your credibility in front of them. Now frame for a common ground. Right. Now, let's say deadlines. Right. Our common ground, you do understand. Let's say the first Janko chay. Right. And our bold Rondra Jain, 15 Jan Kakiyoga. Right. Similar situation that we faced. Right. So the master persuader, any master persuader would always have a common ground which he can, he or she can get through. That's if you're saying 15 Jan, you should come up with seven jan as well, the 7th. Okay. There are many mehramini as a kartana. 7th jan, the middle ground.
Speaker A: Right.
Speaker B: Because it's not always going to be possible to be one sided.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: So give them a middle ground. Okay, let me just, let's say I need just five days more extra and instead of first, we try to deliver your fifth or fifth. So fifth or 7th. So they would agree. They're trying for fifth and 6th. It's really not feasible. Yeah, why not? Right now, of course, we are talking about a lot of, the lot of factors. We're talking about only a few factors, but these are the one boiled down by like thousands of thousand professionals who study Kirk data, Lane kebab. Third is the vivid evidence. Now, what is vivid evidence? Something that, you know, do every, every time in a client meeting. You don't, you just don't tell a feature. You show them the feature. So that is vivid evidence. Vivid, Madlab to imagine it. Are they able to see it, feel it, touch it? Right. In our case, we have to see it. Right. Or maybe you can give them a demo. Demo up and demo. Or as a username, Kushdadia. So that is vivid evidence of how things work. Right. Because you say this is an excellent property. Take a photo, they car. I don't believe you. The property, the person that have you go there, you get a feel of the home, and that's when you trust right. Yeah. I want to take this home. Right. An emotional connect. Let's see. You're technically very sound, but they don't like you. Right. How many times has it happened that you know someone who is the right person to go to for this technical issue, but you don't want to talk.
Speaker A: To that person sometimes.
Speaker B: Right. So that emotional impact, that relationship is very, very important. Right. And for that emotional resilience. So that emotion resilience as well as professionalism. Right. This is work, right. I may be going through hundred different things, but it should not spill over to the maximum extent possible. We are all humans, but it shouldn't be spilled over on someone else. For sure. You know, we strive it, but we should avoid it as much as possible because that emotional connect will be, will matter a lot. Sometimes it will be everything. So another typical example that I've seen online, which made a lot of sense to me. Let's say there's a deal. Take a do communities which may deal over and. And they worked out on everything. And the paper that's a contract is also there. And number one. So person number one says to person, okay, that everything is excellent. Let's shake on it and I'll sign the deal. Oregon, I don't want to shake your hand. So will that person sign it? Give me a few days and everything over. Just because I will not shake your hand. What do you feel that person will say? Something is off. Everything is perfect. Okay. In the contract. Just if the reason is I'm not going to shake your hand, they will not do it. Correct. That emotional connect is also for. Watch out for these four points. Right? Four points. As you said, it looks very, uh, simple. Right. So. But watch out when you persuade, when you're done, able to recall your persuasions. Right. So where can I apply the concept? At least three situations where you are able to or have applied for the concept. Try to fill in those details. So is there a particular factor that you felt if I put this factor here, I might have made it easier. That made my work easier. Maybe is something we can try. This is just a few factors that you can definitely try and do.
Speaker A: So definitely day to day work life.
Speaker B: It is even persuading your kid. I don't know if that you can try it also, right.
Speaker A: But professional life.
Speaker B: Time extension, 50 more minutes. No, five minutes. Common ground. Again, the common ground also works. But they always, huh?
Speaker A: It's always common.
Speaker B: Emotional connect. Both strong.
Speaker A: Last webinar. Do you want me to add anything? I'm not sure if any feedback from you.
Speaker B: So I was busy in this different IVLP from different organization as well. So I was supposed to finish the mid reports. So I'm working on the mid report as soon as finished the mid report to detail the report upcoming with the feedback, right? Kahate Kana Farakua what are things that we want to work on? Right. One prominently other is the energy part itself in the voice, right? Excitement and I think though, I think manage. I think your manager had told you felt more confident and you presented with more confidence. That was one feedback that was given to you for sure, but expectations.
Speaker A: So I was really tense because all things will go down.
Speaker B: Mobida or you were distracted because of everything that was happening for sure that will happen. So enjoy.
