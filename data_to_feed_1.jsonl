So I still remember, you know, my first year at CEAT was all about, you know, bringing back CEAT to profits. So, you know, the first couple of years, you know, that was the fight. So the organization was in a very, very dynamic stage. There were a lot of changes happening all around us, you know, and it was in an experimental mode.

And, you know, that is where with the organization we ourselves, you know, got into a, at a path, you know, which has organized our thoughts, you know, which has given a meaning to the entire way we do business. You know, set out mission goals. You know, it has broken down, you know, at every stage for us how we want to do our business, you know, what are the objectives that we want to achieve, what is the final goal that we have in mind, how, and know what our actions are going to impact the organization in which way.

Then there is the R and D team, which is, you know, part of, you know, testing the products that we offer, you know, getting them to mingle and, you know, making sure that the right product fit is there."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Along with that, the supply chain team of the OEM.

A single point of contact for the entire OEM across their value chain is what my job is."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "All right? So right from the beginning, when the contract is sort of locked, is where you come into picture."}, {"role": "user", "content": "No, even before the contract is logged.

Or, you know, if in case of a new AEM, we try to establish a relationship.

So our internal team is only me, you know, who is the first point of contact.

Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. Because they are the ones who are in charge of, you know, getting new vendors on board."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. All right."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. Whether it's an old vendor or new vendor. But for any project, they are the ones who are in charge.

And then you move on to the R and D team, the supply chain team, and then the customer service team."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. So what it starts with is the entire process starts with something which is known as a RFQ. So that, yeah. So getting that itself is a challenge for C. Okay."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So, you know, that is something, you know, where you actually go showcase your capabilities, what are the capacities that you have, you know, what has been your past experiences, you know, in other fields, how you are doing in other oems, why they should even consider you to, you know, give you an RFQ. Right, right. So all of that is, you know, a pre work to even getting an RFQ, which we do."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "All right, so this. This must be like a pitching meeting to."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Absolutely, absolutely. It's like a pitching meeting."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay.

So we do that. So all of this is basically pitch work. After an RFQ is floated, you know, and then we respond to them, you know, that we are interested in this RFQ. This is what, you know, what, this is the information that we need. So once the interest is generated, they float us a statement of requirement. It's called an SOR."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So by where, basically they give you the vehicle details that this is the vehicle, this is the expected tire size that we want. You know, these are the conditions, these are the technicalities that we want in a tire in terms of loadability, speed and other things. So then we respond to them in consultation with our R and D team. At R and D team, you know, we come to, you know, a conclusion this is the kind of tire that we will give them. These are, you know, the conditions laid down by the OEM. Can we meet them? Yes. No. If there is, you know, going to be a challenge for us or if we can do a better improvement on this. So, you know, all of that is, you know, shared with the OEM and something which is known as a counter proposal."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. All right, so. So generally, do these OEM come to you with a specific tire requirements or."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Absolutely. So most of the times they will come to us with a specific tyre requirement. Until. Unless there are cases, you know, where it's a completely new development, you know, or a field where they are also entering new. So, you know, nowadays the trend is of EV vehicles. So electric vehicles are not. A lot of oems have experience there. So then we actually get together, you know, and we discuss. So that this discussion they have with all other tire suppliers also."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "It's a joint meeting where we actually discuss, you know, what kind of a vehicle they are planning, what kind of a tire we can give, and, you know, how, you know, a particular tire will benefit them."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So you are present there with other, other tire vendors as well, in the same."}, {"role": "user", "content": "No, no, it's not a common meeting. So they will have, you know, individual meetings with all tire supply."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right, okay. All right, got it. So once you receive SOR, then what happens?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "So after the Sor, you know, we go back to them with counter proposal. Okay. And with the counter proposal, we also submit a price. And that is when, you know, the negotiation with starts. Because what happens is, yao, you will be dealing on two fronts. One, you are dealing with the OEM, R and D. Correct. Because my counter proposal may or may not be meeting all the parameters we have, R and D to R and D meeting, you know, which is basically controlled by us, you know, on, you know, what technicalities we need to have where we can compromise, where we can hide. So, you know, a long discussion, you know, which is usually a face to face meeting with the R and D heads between both the companies we actually come across and sit down, you know. Okay, this is the final tire that will be delivered with these technical parameters, with these kind of limits. Okay. So that is one part of the meeting. The other is the price discussion."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "These sort of. Okay, so this is before the price discussion. And this happens after the price."}, {"role": "user", "content": "This happens, you know, parallely because they'll be doing it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right, right. Okay, so at this moment, the. The OEM may not necessarily choose you. He may choose any other vendor as well."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Absolutely. Suppose that, you know, uh, you know, once the price and, you know, the entire tie details are closed, you know, the OEM actually decides on, you know, say they have floated an RFQ to, say five people. They will share it. You know, they will finally nominate. Nominate is where you are confirmed that you are getting this business. So they will nominate out of the five, say two. Okay. So that's basically confirmation of business."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. All right."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. But actually our job does not end there. So once you get the confirmation of business is when you actually start developing a tire basis, you know, so which is the R and D's job. So our R and D and technical team will make the tyre, you know, then there is a, you know, a very long face. Almost nine to ten months of testing. Because the vehicle will also not be ready at the customer, you know, so they will also start developing the vehicle where they will actually start taking the tires and testing. That ten months to twelve months of testing period is there. Again, you know, everything is not objective."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "A lot of subjective calls that have to be taken. So, you know, where, again, you know, it's actually easier said than done. You know, that, you know, it's objective call, then it's easy to be closed. But it's not, that's not how it works. So, you know, there is a lot of negotiation there, again now across a lot of different teams. Right. From the sourcing team to the R and D team to the technical to the testing team."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Sometimes in case, you know, there are also customer service teams. So we do all of that. And finally, once the tire is approved, is when, you know, there is start of business."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. So you are like that one person who's coordinating and orchestrating everything in a project."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Absolutely."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. All right."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And now this is in case of, you know, a project which is yet to go live. Now, there are times, you know, where we are not present in our particular project, you know, and you still want to enter it. That is another round of negotiation which happens, you know, there is a completely different way to approach that. There are multiple channels within an OEM which you have to touch. So you have to actually create an artificial, you know, what do you say, artificial issues, you know, which you have to influence through other teams in the OEM. So you have to use your relationship skills there in order to actually, you know, make that issue, make a un cry in the SEM team that there are no tires available. How, you know, there is poor for another partner. So all of that keeps happening."}]}

Your role looks like a very diverse one. If I look at it from a communication, you know, skill perspective. So there are multiple things that you do and there are all sorts of conversations that you might be having with different people. Now, now there would be definitely some conversations that you have nailed, like, you know, how things are to be carried out. Then there would be some where. There are still some challenges that you may face. Now, this can also be, like you said, subjective. It happens sometimes. It may not happen sometimes. So looking at this whole thing from a communication skills program, leadership skills programs, point of view, tell me some of the things that you would really want this program to, you know, give you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, so two things, you know, which are the utmost priority. One is we need to consider what CEAT is today in the market. We are definitely not the number one player. We are definitely not the number one choice for any partner. For any OEM. Right. So that is our biggest challenge, you know, so in order, whenever we go and actually pitch it to any of the Oems, you know, that we want to know. We considered for a project. The challenge is, you know, that CA does not have a great name in the market. You know, there are equity issues, brand equity issues. You know, your customer equity is very not, is not very strong. The recall is not very strong. Right. That's one big challenge. So in case of communications, you know, if you can give us pointers, you know, on how we can actually deal here and how we can create that Persona around the brand which actually says we are not the biggest, but definitely with the best."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Right. So that will really help us because here we are actually not going to be dealing on objective skills. There is no right or wrong here. It's all subjective, you know, and it's all conversation based. So, you know, just to give you a small example, you know, before, you know, getting into the high end projects in Mahindra, we actually touched waste with nothing less than 14 teams over a period of two years, you know, cracking each of them one by one, you know, you know, basically resolving their doubts, resolving their issues, you know, on past experiences. So we actually went up, you know, right from an SCM buyer who is like the first point of, you know, the lowest point of contact to the CMO of an organization and convincing them, you know, stage by stage, you know, that this is what we have done, you know, so you increase your level of communication, you increase the pointers that you are shown, you know, convince everyone so that was a two year long process. Yeah, we would like to, you know, shorten that down."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Shorten that down. I agree. All right.

So what kind of people are you talking about? What is the situation? Where does it become a soup? All of that situation. If you can give me some basic, even if you want to, you know, remove some confidential things, you can do that. But give me an overall idea who is speaking."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Fair enough. So I'll actually give you a, you know, a case study, you know, which is, you know, at sea at today, which is our entry into Scorpio. So Mahindra's biggest brand is Scorpio, you know, in terms of numbers and in terms of equity also. So we have been trying to do that since 2012. So the entire process, I'm not kidding here, so it actually started in 2012 by my predecessors, you know, that we have to enter Scorpio now in order to do that. We actually first started, you know, our level of, you know, making them understand, you know, why c eight is improving. So there were earlier, you know, issues in the past, you know, where c eight was not a good brand. The ties used to fail a lot. The customer equity was bad. So since 2012, we started pitching for Scorpio."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Now, the first time, you know, because we wanted to build some equity and, you know, we needed to have a face, we actually went ahead and sponsored them for some of their events, you know, so just consider us. That's just, you know, to consider us, you know, okay, we are putting in money to you, so you at least entertain us."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The story is slowly becoming very interesting."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. So that is how we actually got on board to, you know, get the top management to talk because we actually pumped in money into a Mahindra project. So that was the first level. Then, you know, over a period of three years, we actually started talking to the team. And this considered us for their smaller projects, new projects, but smaller ones. You know, they're like, you prove successful here. You do. And then we will think about, you know, Scorpio. Okay? So, uh, you know, we did that in 2015, you know, on a new TUV. We were launched. TKD ties performed well. You know, we got some good feedback points from Mahindra where we improved. And after that they actually started. Okay, now you, we will talk to you about Scorpio."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So in 2016 is when we actually started talking to them on Scorpio. So that is when they actually opened the entire sheet and they are like, these are the different teams. I'll tell you the teams if you want. So starting point, uh, is the marketing manager."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This is specifically for Scorpio."}, {"role": "user", "content": "This is only specific to Scorpio. This is basically the entire team. So how in an oem it works is, you know, there is a team who is working only on a particular project. Right, right. And though that team will be a cross functional team. Okay. So there will be people from customer service, from R and D, from testing, from marketing, from sales, from after service. And all these people come together. Right. And they actually take a call whether we want a new vendor on board, yes or no."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So we actually started touch base with each of these teams. So we first actually had to go and talk to the SEM team. So the SCM team is actually in charge on the day to day operations. At the plant. At the Mahindra manufacturing plant, you know, we actually had to perform well in terms of. Because this is a large volume vehicle for you, we will make sure that tyres are available to you at all point of time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So we made sure, you know, we had a warehouse, you know, tires were stocked all the time. And this is not yet on Scorpio. This is all on a previous vehicle. So we had to build that experience for them so that the SEM team says how, you know, we can rely on CT when it comes to any of the challenges on availability. So we got the SEM team buy in. After the SEM team buy in, we actually had to move to the customer service team because they are actually the ones who are facing the largest issues when a tire fails. So we got to the customer service team, you know, and we started, you know, we spoke to them, we engaged with them on multiple levels. So not only with the team who's sitting at the ho, we actually designed an entire plan where our all India customer service team would go and meet the city heads, state heads and the national heads. Right. Customer service related to the Scorpio or any other vehicle. And, you know, our performance is good when it comes to customer service so that, you know, we are reliable as a partner. If there is an issue tomorrow we will be able to take care of it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So then we know we resolve the customer service thing. After that, you know, we came to the sourcing and the CDMM team. So the R and D team. So the R and D team basically wanted to make sure, you know, that the tyre that we give is actually capable of performing on a Scorpio. That process took two years because they had certain issues. When we launched on an earlier vehicle, they had certain issues in terms of performance. So they actually went ahead into a testing. So our testing and a validation is roughly around nine month thing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So there are multiple levels of test. Right. So before you move on to the second test, the first test, it still takes nine months because what happened is there is something which is known as ride and handling. That is basically to see if this particular tire is actually fit and gives the required comfort in terms of ride, handling and comfort. All three parameters. When, you know, a tire is fitted to a vehicle. Now, in some cases, you know, we cleared one, we did not clear the second. In some cases, we cleared the third one and we missed the other two. So there are a lot of variants of tires which have to be submitted."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Cleared all of that. And finally we actually came to the marketing team. Okay, so the marketing team was like that. My customer, so their point is very clear. We as a marketing team are interested in selling our vehicle and not interested in selling your tire."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "They're like, we will not be putting that effort to sell your tire. If my customer does not want a vehicle fitted with CI tires, I will not take it. Right, right. So where we actually went to the marketing team and we made presentations on how CS brand equity, especially in the SUV segment, has moved across, you know, in the last five years, how we have improved, how we are now second only to MRF. Previously we used to be down five, you know, now how we are second best only to an MRF. How our recall has improved, how customers are not, you know, shying away from buying a CI tyre. We also used a lot of external reports like, you know, we won a JD power award. Showcased the entire presentation that JD Power made to us, you know, on why we got that award."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mahindra and Mahindra team. So then the marketing team was closed. R and D was closed. Customer service was close. SEM was closed. In between, there are a lot of smaller teams that I'm not touching on because these are the main guys. And then finally we had to actually take Anant Goenka RMD to meet the CPO, Mister Heman Sikha. And there, finally, we actually got an. Go. Go ahead. Okay. You know, we will try you on Scorpio. So that. So this is, you know, in brief, a nine year, seven year thing, you know, which I've given to you in a brief of seven minutes, a lot of effort, which actually got into, you know, just getting an approval."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right, right. So these are the kind of conversations that you have with different. Right. Who are the ones that you interact on a very frequent basis?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Like, three of them. Okay, so three of them. One is the sourcing team. So we have, uh, roughly, you know, we touch base with them at least twice a week."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. And what level are these people like?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Senior managers, GM's and vice presidents."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. All right."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So in a Mahindra or any other OEM, a senior manager is as good as a vice president of any other bank. So a senior manager is very powerful guy. So we. Because there are four layers below him also, our conversation starts with him. So we have built that kind of relationships in almost all OEMs then that we can start with these guys."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So that's one. That's the sourcing team is the SEM team with whom we are operating. And, you know, in having conversations on a daily basis, operational issues."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Right. Tire availability, Tire not reached, Vehicle not reached. So. Which are basically a given, but still, you know, because there are still, you know, certain issues with CEAT which we are trying to resolve. There are daily issues which are created, which we try to resolve."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "And in amongst the same team, there is, you know, a role which is called the buyer. Right. Every SEM team, every SEM, every manufacturing plant will have a buyer. Buyer is in charge of a commodity. Right."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "In particulars, for tires, there will be one buyer in the entire plant. Right. And he will be in charge for getting the tires for all vehicles that are made in that plant to coordinate with the tire manufacturers and make sure that the tires for all vehicles that are being manufactured are available at all points of time. He's the most crucial guy when it comes to operations for us."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. All right. So the buyer is another party that you interact with."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Absolutely. Thirdly, there is the R and D team. Right. Because we have new developments happening all the time. Plus there are new projects which are being manufactured which are being planned by the oems all the time we interact with them. You can pretty much say on a weekly basis more if there is no project, you know, it's more of a high and hello relationship meeting, you know, trying to get some market intelligence. What are the new projects they are working on? You know, when can we expect something? We touch with them on a weekly basis, but the other two, the operations team is on a daily basis at the SEM sourcing team is on weekly basis, you know, more than, you know, almost three times a week. And then there is the R and D team."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. All right. And let's say if, you know, you're with a particular OEM and you're speaking to them and different groups there, different departments there, let's say if there's a new project or something new that you have to talk to them. So do you have to start the same channel right from the beginning or you can then directly go and speak to the R and D team?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Or is it possible we can do that? So, you know, that depends upon the kind of relationship that you build with them, right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So once, you know. So now what happens is before a project is an RFQ is even floated, you know, we have been able to gather that much market intelligence. You know, we have that kind of relationship going that, you know, we come to know, okay, you know, this is the project which is going to come up, say, in the next three months. And so you, you know, get your preparedness, you know, you prepared, you know, when the RFQ sorted, you know, that the tie details are closed, you know, you know what to do, you know whom to touch. So, no, that pre work has already been done."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a english communication coach named 'Vani'. You are having a conversation with learner to find out about his job profile and analyze the answers that learner provides and ask more questions"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Got it. So I do have a detailed idea about the kind of work that you do. The most important need that you mentioned is about how do you get the buy in from different people at different levels that you speak to, any other aspect that you would really look forward to in the program, maybe some challenges that you face or something that you aim to improve further where you are right now."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay. So another thing, you know, today with the oems is you need to understand seat's history or seat is not a preferred partner right now for a lot of OEM, you know."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So how the OEM and a tire and c at relationship, you know, how it works is we are always on the back foot. Rarely do we actually get to, you know, come on the front foot and take a shot. You know, it's always, you know, we are in a defensive position most of the times. You know, that's because of, you know, some of the issues, past history, brand recall, you know, a lot of, you know, parameters are there to it. So it becomes very difficult to say no. You know, if an audience makes a request or even not a request is, you know, it's more like an. Currently, the situation is, you know, you know, you cannot say no to him."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Yeah. So with all these baggage, you know, if we actually come up, you know, with something, you know, where we can actually come into a position where we can have a fair fight, you know, because it's not that, you know, the OEM is right. Always OEM to use his positions to, you know, push down, you know, on us so that he can say, get an advantage in terms of price, in terms of availability. He can use it in many ways."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Because at the end of the day, it's a supplier, vendor, supplier and a buyer kind of a relationship, customer relationship. So, you know, they are always in a strong position, but, you know, we would like to have a fair playing field for most of it. Right. So that kind of a communication, you know, we can just figure out. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a english communication coach named 'Vani'. You are having a conversation with learner to find out about his job profile and analyze the answers that learner provides and ask more questions"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. All right, great. Yeah. So I do see a lot of scope in terms of, you know, the words that you would choose. How would you strategize your conversations there in order to get to this position of fair play? All right. Okay. All right. Anything other than this. Yes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You were saying one more thing. So you need to understand, you know, at, from cs point of view, it's not only us, you know, as the OEM sales team who's interacting with them. There are other players also."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The other biggest role is played by the R and D team, who is also part of this program."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Okay. All right. So you're saying that the R and D team is also a part of this entire process. And you would like to have a better communication with them as well."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Right. So they. Because, you know, there are a lot of technical discussion, you know, which happens between the R and D team and the M and M, or, you know, the OEM R and D team, a lot of calls are taken there. Right. So how we can make this entire communication, you know, between us and the R and D team a lot stronger so that we are always on the same page, we see more often than not more often we are, because we, before having any discussion, we close it between ourselves. But to get these guys also, you know, to talk the same language is very important because the R and D team is not that tactful. So where we can add to them or, you know, where they can add to us is also something, you know, that we need to figure out because it's a tripartite kind of a discussion. To figure that out."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So correcting only one chain may not help. You'll have to go through the whole entire. Okay."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Especially the R and D team. Especially the R and D team with us."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right. Because they have most of the conversations with them."}, {"role": "user", "content": "With your technical team. Yes. With your technical team. Yes. Because that is actually the make and break of, you know, any new project."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a english communication coach named 'Vani'. You are having a conversation with learner to find out about his job profile and analyze the answers that learner provides and ask more questions"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Agreed. Agreed. All right. Okay. So I do have a fair amount of idea from this call as of now. I also have, you know, noted the points that you mentioned that you would like to receive from this workshop. Is there anything else that you feel that, you know, we as coaches should know about, you know, you or the team or whatever, so that when we are coming for a workshop that we design specifically for you, it may help."}, {"role": "user", "content": "So, you know, just, I'm sure you guys already must have got this brief, you know, from the others also. And I'm sure, you know, you know, there are going to be discussions, but try not to dwell too much on the negotiation basics, you know, because I'll be very frank here. You know, we have all been doing this job tick, and we are dealing with multiple people. So what happens is a lot of these communication, you know, workshops don't. Well, on the real issues, they can come to us on teaching what is negotiation? You know, I've been learning that from the MBA days. I'll be very probably would know it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Better than what we."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Absolutely. We're doing it on the job on a daily basis. Don't go on the negotiation, you know, on what are the different tactics of negotiation. Try to give us real life issues, you know, which we are trying to share with you and make the role plays very effective, you know, on how it can be effective. That is one thing. Second is, you know, a lot of times, a lot of training programs try to keep it very clear as if the life is, you know, a blackboard and, you know, everything is black, which is not. Yeah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Absolutely. Absolutely. I agree."}, {"role": "user", "content": "A lot of things actually depend on a lot of relationships, you know, agree. Yeah. So, you know, it's a. It's a two hour talk with a customer. The business discussed for five minutes. The other, you know, 115 minutes are actually gossip or, you know, other shit, you know, that we have to discuss with them. Yeah. So what happens is, you know, a lot of times you guys just focus on those five minutes. That's not how it works."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah. The major part is the other conversation that you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Absolutely, absolutely got it."}]}

All right, great. So these two points would really help us in designing the program. We would go back and, you know, listen to these calls again internally discuss all these things that you have mentioned. So if. In case I have some queries later. Or if I feel that some or other place. I missed something. Missed asking you something. I'll get back to you. I'll send you an email. If you're free, let me know. A free time and have a conversation."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Fair enough. Pratistha, I think we have a lot of time now. I think the program has been postponed."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Postponed? Yes. So it is going to be in, I think, 26, 27 May. Around that time it is shifted to end of May. So we have some time now."}, {"role": "user", "content": "We have some time now. Fair enough."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "All right. Great. Thank you so much."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thank you, Pratishta. Thanks a lot."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you.
