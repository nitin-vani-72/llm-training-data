Speaker A: That's I am learning it there and I have prepared, I think you have to see it then over there last time I will there at that forum.
Speaker B: You shared. Yes sir.
Speaker A: Yes, yes.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Actually I am.
Speaker B: Okay in the workshop.
Speaker A: You'Re saying yes, yes in the workshop.
Speaker B: Yes, we saw the PPT. We saw both the ppts. They were a very good start. Good start. So TK, so do you remember the tool that we discussed?
Speaker A: Yeah, I remember that. There are four tools I think first is first who then why, how and what.
Speaker B: So what is your understanding?
Speaker A: Basically there are four tools. So first the who. That means who is the listener and what is the impact at there what I am presenting that time. So there have, I think who have four areas, context, expectation, usability and personality as per server ECBT. Then in who parts that time we have basically we are putting there what he asks the data what he want to see at that forum and how does he want to do. Who is he, who is the expector? Suppose that I am presenting somewhere data. So someone is asking to me just prepare a PPT and he's giving some points. So suppose their management is asking me just you have to prepare a PPT as like that for a Munka expectation care points to point. So who is my son? Suppose my management team, either ho team or either my regional boss. So he's giving me some points and he wants to need a PPT according to this. So as per personality, suppose that my boss is asking to me, you know, prepare a PPT of data analysis like that in financial kajobi. So just my boss is asking to me and I am prepared as per points what he is giving to me, given to me. So based on that I have prepared a PPT and I will present over there and then he's asking maybe he's asking some question and I will answer to him.
Speaker B: Okay, so yes, so who, according to whom are you going to prepare the who is your listener here in this example?
Speaker A: Listener is my boss or either management team.
Speaker B: Okay, so now, and now from who we come to the why of it. So why do you want the ppt?
Speaker A: Sorry I'm unable to hear you.
Speaker B: Can you hear me now?
Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker B: So why do they want the ppt? What is the purpose?
Speaker A: Purpose is basically suppose you want to see that what is the actual financial situation in between period of suppose SWPL. So he want to see that the financial status of this financial year. So he want to see that actually this one.
Speaker B: So he wants to see the status quo.
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: Yeah, it's a question. So why does he want to know about the status of this financial year from you? What is it going to help him do?
Speaker A: Because I am preparing all those things and he want to expect from me. Now you have to present this one data. You have to share with me this data and he will look at all.
Speaker B: So usability, right?
Speaker A: Yes. Yes.
Speaker B: Yeah. So you know your boss's personality. How is he she, right?
Speaker A: Yes. Yes.
Speaker B: The context is also clear to you that the status of the financial year batana hai, right?
Speaker A: Yes. Or katha context expectation. What do you want? What do you want to expect from me?
Speaker B: Yes. So expectation be upcoming status. Jana. So that is expectation. So what is, you know, why does he or she, whoever your boss is, let's take it's a he. I think let's just consider it as a. As a he. So why does your boss want to know about the financial status? What is the purpose? What is the usability? What is it? What is he going to use this for?
Speaker A: Suppose I am sharing with my boss to status of in between of six month period. My actual revenue is this one. Because he will also present some another forum for this value. Either his boss is asking to him, I know that what is the actual revenue of this this much period time. So that's why he's asking to me. And first of all, you he want to see that. And then he will present over there or either company status. He want to see that key what is the actual company addressed or in that period.
Speaker B: Okay. So there has to be a purpose behind that, right? So whatever action will take, right? If there are, if he knows that speed is, then he will have to take some corrective measures. Or if he says that, okay, so can we do something, right? So he will make decisions based on the status that is important, right?
Speaker A: Yes. Yes. Right.
Speaker B: That is the usability. So it is important for your boss to make decisions. So this is how you have to think about the listener, right? How is my presentation, my meeting points going to be used by the people who are listening to me, right? So you have to keep that in mind. Why do you have to keep that in mind? So that relevant information pass on Nagari them information. We end up passing too much information then first of all, it wastes our time, their time. Second, it takes too much time, right? Because we have a lot of work to do, right? I boss and he told me that Varun is the one who does all the work, right? You have to prepare all that and everything. Meeting data prepare can never bought time like that.
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: You will also get irritated. The other person will get irritated. Come nay over. So. So that is. That is all. That is the who and the why part. We can.
Speaker A: How.
Speaker B: So how is basically data, right? So how you highlight the important numbers and figures. How can you present the data in an easy manner so that your top management can understand it very easily because you are from the financial field, right? Your top management.
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: Come time.
Speaker A: Yes. Easy way to how to express in short time period. My all expectant. What you want to expect I will present over there in short time and understandable value. Chaki.
Speaker B: Correct. So can you have big huge tables? No, you cannot have big huge tables of data. You have to have graphs, you have to have pie charts or things like that, right? So the PPT might be a little long, but at least it's going to be interesting, right?
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: And you will have to give them insights, right?
Speaker A: Right.
Speaker B: You have a lot of things, right? You have projections, you have.
Speaker A: Yes. Suppose. Suppose I have some budget figure in the beginning of the financial year. We are some budgeting figure of whole year. And after that we are tracking month basis. Keep what is the actual figure comes on based on that one. So we are basically analysis of that figure. Key what we are budgeting at beginning of time and after six months where we are.
Speaker B: Correct.
Speaker A: So that comparison are. We are basically swing at that forum.
Speaker B: Correct. Correct. Right. So you need to know what the purpose of that comparison is. And you need to show that comparison in a very easy way so that your boss takes maybe a minute or two to understand or even less. Right. So that is your how part. That is your method. Finally, what are you presenting? So Usmay Sejo theme insights Nikol Kara Kikul Melake Sir Hamara projection. This is. We are lagging behind or this is where we are exceeding expectations or this is the area we need to take care of. So those two, three, five points have.
Speaker A: To be listed, right?
Speaker B: Yeah. So this is your tool, mind map. If you think mind map is useful for you, you can use that. So all your ideas you can put down in a piece of paper.
Speaker A: Yes, you're. You're right.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Right. Achal is saying this word and I am keeping in my mind. So definitely I will apply in next time. And when I am presenting some other PPT, definitely I will.
Speaker B: Yes. This is our revision of the tool. You already have the document. You can keep referring to it.
Speaker A: Yeah, I have.
Speaker B: So now we'll just do a small activity. So this is for your structure, but we'll have to work a little bit on language as well right. Otherwise it's confusing. So you can pick up any topic if you want to prepare I'll give you two minutes for it. To preparing your. To prepare your points and then you have to speak on it for three minutes. We'll record it.
Speaker A: Any topic.
Speaker B: Any topic. Three minutes.
Speaker A: I. I frequently speak at there. Now. Abhi karnaye now. Okay. Now just I am taking suppose that today I am presenting some mis report. How to prepare mis report.

So they have lot of person of Ho team and I am putting there my views and how to prepare this mis. How to get it this report from SAP and how to deliver in m excel.

So all those things I am sharing with my colleagues today and some others suppose that I am passing some entry in SAP and what impact goes into some reports. Suppose debtors report suppose outstanding reports. So I will explain it there how to come over there. So just I make some entries in manual basis and I will share with this forum. So all these tools I will. I am sharing with my all colleagues today. I don't know key. That time I will. That time I am. Every time say that time I am talking in only Hindi because I cannot speak frequently English. So definitely I am using some words but I cannot speak frequently basis.
Speaker B: No problem. Okay. Hello.
Speaker A: Yes. Yes. Yes.
Speaker B: Yeah. Is that it?
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: Okay. Okay. Yeah this is. This is really good. Although. So how did you uh. What is your feedback to yourself in terms of. So how did you do?
Speaker A: Sorry ma'am I am unable to read you again. Can you repeat again?
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: Sorry. Your phones. Okay. So I was asking you what is what feedback would you give yourself in terms of language so if you heard yourself.
Speaker A: Myself.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Myself.
Speaker B: Yeah. So how did you do?
Speaker A: I actually I. I always try to do my best. So how can I say that key now? I will give feedback myself to you. You have to, I think, better know to me what I am going.
Speaker B: No, no worries. I mean, I, of course, can give feedback, right? I can give the feedback, but, um, if you realize that it is easier to work on it, right. If somebody does.
Speaker A: I know. I know that when I am speaking, I know that I am. When I am speaking in English, in terms of English that time, I am using some word like that. Verbs, verbs, use it. I think I am not using best way that I am thinking. I don't know. I think I knew. I. I think I mistake verb points. I am doing mistake, I think.
Speaker B: Yes. So a little bit, actually, not completely, but yes, we can work on that. So if you remember the first workshop, we talked about strong verbs and weak verbs, do you remember?
Speaker A: Yes, I know that.
Speaker B: So we'll revise that and we will work on it. Okay? Wait, can you hear me?
Speaker A: Yes, I can.
Speaker B: Okay. Okay, so I'm gonna revise it very quickly here and then we'll end. So, yeah, so these are some. Okay, so these are some weak verbs. Weak verbs. Meaning when you said, you know, you're doing mistake. So we don't do a mistake. We make a mistake. Right. That only place makes a he hota. There are so many times I am doing a presentation or I am giving presentation. We don't give a presentation. We either deliver a presentation or we present. Right. So that is how we. So it is a very common. This thing. It's a very common mistake. But what we have to do is we have to avoid this. Right. Coming to my mind, instead, you can say, I cannot think of anything. Right?
Speaker A: Right.
Speaker B: So why this happens? Why do we use weak verbs? These are weak verbs. I'll just label them. Give me a minute. Yeah. So these are weak verbs. Instead, we have to avoid using these weak verbs. Weak verbs. Matlab jinka koi, actual meaning nahi hai. Use hojata uske jaga. We have to use strong verbs, right. So you know all the other verbs are basically strong verbs, right. So deliver a presentation, think of something. Right. I am coming by car. I am traveling by car, right. Or I am arriving to the office or I am arriving at any of that. Right. So this is how you can, you can change your verbs. So this is why. Because you, you don't want the other person to get confused. What do you mean by, like, for example, somebody said, oh, you are doing a marathon. What do you mean by doing a marathon? So are you running a marathon. Are you participating? Are you judging? What do you mean by doing a marathon? Right. So it is confusing, right?
Speaker A: Right.
Speaker B: Yeah. Same goes for doing mistake. What do you mean by doing? Are you correcting the mistakes? Are you making mistakes? Are you reading about mistakes? What? Right. So I am making a mistake, right? So that, for example, you used a very nice. You said I have to prepare a presentation. So that is absolutely correct. Right. You prepare presentation. You don't make presentations. I am making this. I am making food. I am making presentation. But it's not the same thing, right? I am. I am preparing a presentation. So this is the difference between strong verbs and weak verbs. Are they pick there which I like. Sentence. Right. How many? Svo tikha. Sentence puragalate. Right. So I like many things. Okay. Simply likra. I like many things. M a y n. Many.
Speaker A: M a n y. I like many things.
Speaker B: Some problem is there some problem is there OCD English made albia. Right. Instead is a problem with one, two, three. Take care. There's a Mary computer. There is a problem with my computer.
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: But I am facing an issue with my computer. Right. So we try to use svopt and strong verbs instead of weak verbs. And directly translating from English, sorry. Hindi. Right. Because Indians say bhat karna kush problem. If you talk to people from other countries or if you talk to people from the south. So it is very difficult to understand, for them to understand. And it is important where, because, you know, if we don't. So language is the best way to make a relationship, right? Sorry. Make is wrong. Build a relationship.
Speaker A: Build the.
Speaker B: Build a relationship. Build trust. Build a relationship. Yeah. So you have to keep in mind two things. Using strong verbs and avoiding translation. Okay, so how will you do it?
Speaker A: I will keep in mind.
Speaker B: Okay, so how will you.
Speaker A: Definitely, I will try next time. More strong words.
Speaker B: Okay. Strong verbs. How will you try to avoid translation?
Speaker A: When I will speak in. In English that time I will use svopt. Yes. I will keep in mind how to apply in Sbbot. Yeah, I will. And I will try to express myself.
Speaker B: Great, great. See, you're already started. That is great. Okay. We had talked about developing a habit. Yes. Okay. You were supposed to read every day.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: Do you.
Speaker A: I have installed in my phone translator. And there are some app and there are, I think 52 classes. So just I am reach. I am across two classes and I will try. I'm trying a daily may classes Karun. But.
Speaker B: Eight beer page. Do page.
Speaker A: It is my courses. I'm trying my best. Yes, I know. That. Definitely. I'm trying my best.
Speaker B: Library. Hato Mahapal. You have a lot of classes instead reading. Ten minutes, you're done. And it is much better in a reading is your workshop. Workshop field. Sterling and Wilson. Okay, so let's. Let's think of it this way. You have an intern. You want to teach him all the he upside hotel manual. Right? They can manual, say, limited actual experience. He'll have to touch the instruments. He'll have to feel them. He'll have to see how they work, or he'll have to work on them. Right. So. English. Sick. Nakeli. English. Bonaparte. TK. That is your site. So going on site is reading TK. Sorry. No, ma'am.
