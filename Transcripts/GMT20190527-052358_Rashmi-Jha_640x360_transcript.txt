Speaker A: Okay, good. It.
Speaker B: It's.
Speaker A: It.
Speaker B: It. It.
Speaker A: Let's begin.
Speaker B: Hello friends. Today we are discussing about GST and its benefits. First, you know about what is GST. GST is a goods and service tax. It is an indirect tax and it is imposed on goods and services. It is consolidated of all other indirect taxes. That is weight entry tax, service tax, excise duty and it is refunded to all parties in various stages in form of ITR other than final consumer. It is a destination based tax. So it is related to destination of supplier and purchaser. Tax is charged by two ways inter interstate into by two ways. First, interstate purchase and second is local purchase. In local purchase it is charging CGST and SGSt and interested purchase. It is IGST. One benefit is it is single. It is one tax rate. In our whole country. In previous practice, we are charging so many taxes, just like excise duty, service tax, weight, entry tax, CST. But in GSt we are charging only one text Gst. For example, in previous practice we are charging excise duty on basic value. Then we are charging weight or CST and total of basic plus excise duty. And in interstate purchase we have to charge entry tax. Also in new practice, we are charging only base GST on basic value and other checks. Other taxes are not applicable. So it is better than our previous practice. And in GST we have to submit only one return. But in our previous practice, we have to submit so many returns. So many returns. Just like wait, entry tax, exercise duty, service tax. Now we have to submit only one return. So it is better and simplified also. And one other thing is in previous practice we are charging CST on interstate sales. There are two types of rates. One is full rate on without concessional form and second is 2% on concessional rate with concession form. Due to this practice we have facing. We are. We are facing lot of problems to collecting concessional forms from parties. Now one text is applicable in GST for interstate sale. Then this problem is also solved because we don't have to collect any forms from parties. So this reason is also for better. Then another reason is timely. We are getting timely refunds in GST. GST is online so we receive our refunds timely. In previous practice, we are submitting manually applications for our refunds and we have to pay money for government officers to clear our refund. In new practice, it is online so we don't have to pay any money to government officers. So it is reduce our expenses and we are receiving our refunds timely. Also. In GST, there are some facilities for small businessmen or small entrepreneurs who have less than 20 lakhs turnover. They exam to take registration in GST. And one more facility for that is composition scheme. In this scheme, small entrepreneurs or businessmen have to pay 1% amount of their turnover. And they don't have to submit monthly returns. So it is better for small entrepreneurs also due to one tax rate we are in our pre respective. We are charging service tax on various types of services. And the tax rates are also different in different services. So our this problem also solved on services also. One tax rate in all India. All in whole country. So it is better than our previous taxes.
Speaker A: How will you conclude it?
Speaker B: Yes. Yes. So after. After all these advantages, it is. After all these advantages, it is more easy and simplified from our previous taxes. And it is better for. It is better to reduce corruption also. So I think it is more comfortable to. It is more comfortable to us to accept this GST.
Speaker A: Okay. One here. So you spoke well, right?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: This. Do you like Narendra Modi?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: You do like, right? So imagine the energy he has in voice. Abide kisi agar. Businessman Kobatare. Advantages point we have, right? You told me that there is only one system now, right? So what I want you to do is because I'm helping you to prepare for the final presentation. Right. So you are. You have a workshop. Second workshop. Correct. So there you will have a final presentation.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Okay. So look, when you are talking about GST, right, and you like Narendra Modi, you like the policy. So that energy should be there.
Speaker B: Okay?
Speaker A: Right. So here, look, if I have to talk about GST and if I like it, so I would say something like this. I mean, the energy that I'm talking about. Okay. So it has so many advantages. First, there is only one system.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: So you do not have to pay entry tax, VAT, then sales tax and then excise duty. So this is all gone. So there is only one tax and one implementation.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Okay. So this is how you know you should support Savasa Dikhna Chayeki, support Kara, GST. Go. Okay.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Next time. I mean, if you are choosing this topic for the final presentation, GST and the implementation, use this energy supporting energy. First thing. Second thing, summarize. Right. So don't only end there, that this is advantageous. This is beneficiary, this is the beneficial policy, or this is going to benefit every one of us. Summarize. Last time, remember, we had done it. That if you have the seven minute presentation, if you have to summarize it in a minute or two, three sentences, how will you do that? So in your GST, the important point was that all the extra taxes are gone. Now it's one entry point and one exit point. Right. You. You submit online, you get your refund online.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Right. You have. If you, uh, you know, you. If you're maintaining it monthly, then at the end of the year, it is also easy. You know, you are not looking for all the papers.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Right. So give it. Summarize it in two or three sentences. Your entire presentation.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Okay. And some more energy.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Last thing. Okay. Because we have discussed it all along. Right. So whenever you are talking about our previous system. Previous system may char. So we. There were four taxes. Right. Four types or five types. Right. Which tense will you use? Right. Perfect. Okay.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: So more energy support for GST. Summarize your entire presentation in two or three sentences with few highlighting advantages. Right. And the third, when. When you are you talking about the previous policy, you must use simple past tense. Okay, cool. So all the best for your final presentation. Right? I am now hoping that Ashish comes and tells me. Rashmi bha tachagam kiya. Okay. Girish has done a fabulous presentation.
