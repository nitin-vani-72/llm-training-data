Speaker A: So just a minute. Just a minute. Hello?
Speaker B: Hello? Yeah. Okay.
Speaker A: Yeah, I'm there.
Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. Okay, great. So I think we have decided that you would prepare something on.
Speaker A: Sorry.
Speaker B: We had decided that you would prepare something like a short speech or something on listening. Listening.
Speaker A: On listening. Closing. I couldn't prepare actually we were doing on something male.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Right.
Speaker B: So we had looked at meals and we had also seen, in fact I remember your meals were perfect.
Speaker A: Short name.
Speaker B: But egg line. May Bohasara ninja. What are the words? You know, difficulty. So would you like to take maybe five minutes, ten minutes and prepare something so we can do the exercise?
Speaker A: Like in what, what type of things you are thinking of on which particular topic you can share me a topic. It was basically if you can give me any topic so I can prepare it and I can refresh it right now.
Speaker B: So I will say I gave you the topic which is the importance of listening in your job role.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: Your job role, TK. So you can prepare like a five minute speech or something like that. And we'll do the exercise, right. Wherein I can extract your sentences and we'll try to, we'll try to see if, you know, your choice of words can be better. So yeah, you can take five minutes or ten minutes and you can prepare.
Speaker A: Okay, great.
Speaker B: Okay. Yeah. Now you can start.
Speaker A: So what I, as per the subject given to me is understanding, I mean knowing the importance of listening in my sales profile. Listening as you know that listening is the much most important tool in the overall communication set. What we operate in day to day. And if I break down, this is as per the research which I have done recently with Google is they have given a bifurcation of communication. That is the return. The return consumes 9%, the reading consumes 16%, the talking consumes 30%. And the maximum listening which consumes 45% of this is the entire, you know, percentage of a communication where if you, if you can analyze that listening is a much more and important factor which comes into the account. So because why? Because we spend maximum time, say in our 1818 to 16 hours of job role or curriculum, what we do daily. The maximum part is of listening means we listen, the maximum will listen, the maximum we analyze the maximum. We self, you know, analyze and we think, we think more and more and we come to a conclusion that this may be a right solution to the problem which has been, which has come up as a communication to us which has during, during our entire, you know, in a day entire communication which happened. So because we spent much more in listening, it is important. It is effective to us. So as I said, that it is listening is an overall physical as well as psychological process that involves acquiring, assigning meaning and responding whatever message is being communicated from other. So this is a summary of listening which I think is important into the sales profile, basically listening. If I say listening, I can quote it that as I see many of the leaders currently as my regional manager as say Narendra Modi, say any entrepreneur, say activist who are an sales booster or they basically guide or say they are the leaders who they try to guide or say they try to. What are the sessions? Influence, not only influence, they are the basically who come like right now you guys are doing means you are setting up a benchmark where you guys are trying to influence, inculcate our grammatical or say through a communication list of maximum time. What is the communication between us is that half a time you speak and half a time I speak. And if a proper result has been, you know, been fetched out of the overall communication, we do so many. What, what I was trying to say is that many successful leader entrepreneurs, basically they credit themselves and their success to effective listening. Basically this because of the effective listening, they are up to this particular mark or say position. So the question is the good listening skills also have benefited personal lives, including like the maximum I, you know, listen to the family members, to my colleagues or say to my savannah wife. So this improves the self confidence. This gives an importance into their life that the person is listening to us. He is respecting our suggestions or say talks, whatso we can say the social network, the friend circles increases. If you see in fact we generate a good well being through this listening. This were a few, you know, important skills which I have observed and I have just jotted out. In fact, other than this, if I say add on to my day to day operational or say day to day job profile as per, as per my job profile, what, what would be better soothing on the listening skill would be it, you know, if, if I'm, if I'm a good listener, it reciprocates that I'm able to solve problem or say I'm able to understand that the actual query of my team. Suppose if there are five person into my team and they are just repeatedly asking for something or they are suggesting me for something or they are trying to get any solution for an query which has occurred during the phase to them through listening or say, through analyzing. See, as I listen to them then only I will be able to self analyze and I will be able to connect, have a better connect to the solution and to the problem. The guy who is facing the problem through the interpretation, through analyzing that this may be a solution or listening or the same thing. The same problems can be narrated to my, you know, superiors. I can question them. So this is, these are the problems which are getting encountered within the field. And what may be this, what would be the solution to this? And whatever they suggest, this listening can play an important role in my, you know, day to day curriculum. And I can, the same things can be narrated to my team members into a better soft, you know, so that they can understand. So listening skills plays a very important role in the overall job profile currently which we are working with. We are working in. Sorry. So this is what I have prepared till now. You can continue. Shreya. I'm done.
