Speaker A: Yeah. So okay. So the further update, Deepak has left the organization. So you have been transferred to me.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: So I needed a little brief on your conversations with Deepak so that I know what is done and what needs to be taken forward with. And of course there has been a three to four months gap between our coaching goals itself.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Tell me a little brief of whatever you remember the conversations you had. If you have done any presentations. Of course I have the data with me. But I also want to make sure I don't miss anything.
Speaker B: No issues sir. Actually in my first class with Deepak sir, brief introduction regarding my job profile and what is my basic work, what I have to done. Apart from that he also asked me whatever the area of improvement which I personally needed and feel that I should improve in that particular area. So we discussed about that also. Apart from that sir, in next session he gave me a presentation on the topic of GPS systems. So I make a presentation and for not more than four, just four or five minutes presentation is there sir. So I made a presentation of the GPS. And after that in next, next coaching session he told me that also prepare a presentation on the same topic gps but the future of gps in India. So I prepared that in this session discussed regarding presentation. Apart from that sir, next session he sent me a slide, data is there. So he just told me to read the slide first time and try to remember and then tell me whatever you learned from the slide and what you understand from that and how, how many things you can recall from that. So these are the four, four or five classes with Deepak sir. And so these are the all things which we cover with him.
Speaker A: Can you explain a little more about the last one? I'm not able to catch that one. So what was the activity exactly? So it sent you a slide you say what was that in the slide?
Speaker B: Actually uh, he sent a one slide that was just a reading practice. Reading habits that time he want to just, just check how exactly I'm able to read and how much things I recall from reading and what is my understanding when I read again. So just this is for that. So like that in this meeting you send me a slide. After that you told me that next presentation and our next communication meeting we will read, we will go through the reading of the slide. So that was the activity. The name of that wave at was the topic of the flight. Wave at 30.
Speaker A: Huh? Wave. I think I didn't get that.
Speaker B: Yes sir. Biv site is there just like wave at 30 years ago. What was the scenario bib site was not developed. So these types how it developed.
Speaker A: Concept website.
Speaker B: No, actually the topic was babe at 30 means 30 year ago when there was not any email. How was the life that was a topic of presentation. So these are the things in that presentation. So I did the whole things. So these are the.
Speaker A: So in two to three presentations that you had with Deepak, what was the feedback that was given to you and what were things that he said were your areas of improvement?
Speaker B: So little bit sound disturbance is there. Sir, please repeat one.
Speaker A: Okay. Let's keep the video off so that we can communicate in a clear manner. Right? Map. I've got a video one karao. Right? So is my voice clear now?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: I think a little better. Right. So tell me, Jobna. Dot in presentations. The. What was the feedback given by Deepak? Right. So if you remember any of the many prominent ones that he said, you. These are things that you need to work on.
Speaker B: Actually, sir, he told me that I have to focus on my communication regarding pronunciation. And also focus on the framing, the sentences. And also improve the reading habits. So you also suggest me to improve the reading hair by practicing ten to 15 minutes daily. Regarding improve your voice tone also. So these are the things which suggest me to develop myself.
Speaker A: All right. Develop also what? Let's say we. Let's just say. Call it voice modulation also.
Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker A: All right. So tell me about your reading habits. Are they. Have you been able to continue them.
Speaker B: Or how is it?
Speaker A: Because I understand with the pandemic, I'm sure the workload has definitely increased a lot.
Speaker B: Yeah. So actually after that a lot of gap also there, sir. In our classes also. So little breakdown.
Speaker A: Let's see it as habits that we need to form in order to reach where we are, right?
Speaker B: Yes, sir.
Speaker A: So you have to be sure that you're not doing it for Deepak. You're not doing it for me. That really exercise is something that you have to continue for yourself, right?
Speaker B: Definitely, sir.
Speaker A: In time you will have to seek. Okay. What is it that interests you? Some like reading fiction novels. Some write self help books. Jyoti, some people like in newspaper is fine. I like to get, you know, understand what's happening. Some people buy magazines. Basically what you must have a habit is reading. Reading a habit. Go home. Go inculcate. Karna. Hi. Paragraph, right? Because that is the only one of the, you know, very effective ways of getting comfortable with the english language.
Speaker B: Yes, sir.
Speaker A: English is not our first language, right? Mother tongue. So whatever we speak would be a translation, right?
Speaker B: Yes, sir.
Speaker A: So your mother tongue is Hindi or what is it?
Speaker B: Hindi, sir.
Speaker A: Right. Hindi.
Speaker B: Exactly, sir. Basically, I'm from Madhya Pradesh. Bhupal. Yeah.
Speaker A: MP may bolzakta Hindi. Wampa. Should the Hindi. English may translate. Hoga. You notice that there are word order errors and translational. You cannot talk the same way in English. And it goes the same way. You cannot just say English. Same cheese. Hindi minae. Right. And that is the reason a lot of dubbed movies are very hilarious.
Speaker B: Yes, sir.
Speaker A: Because you cannot directly translate the way that a person speaks in one language to another. So even if you watch a Hindi movie in English.
Speaker B: Tumbalogayana job bull. Exactly.
Speaker A: That is the limitation of it, right?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: If you not exactly translate everything, right. So very effective example is if, let's say foreigner, mila and like interesting laga translate kirkho. So do you think that you'll be able to translate circuits joke into English and have the same effect that it has in Hindi?
Speaker B: No, sir. I think not.
Speaker A: It's he will foreigner building. What's funny in this, right?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: So that's how languages are. So you have to. When you read more and even watch news in English or watch some series. English series. Voltage or serial, you will get to know conversations.
Speaker B: Yes, sir.
Speaker A: We need to form full sentences that it looks even more professional. And that is what Deepak was trying to do with. With more and more exercise of presentations. Correct?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Take it up with more feedback also. Right. Now tell me to. In order to express ourselves better, we also need to develop a vocabulary. Yes, vocabulary. What do you mean by vocabulary?
Speaker B: So vocabulary means vocabulary.
Speaker A: The word that we are using. Correct. Right. But seek vocabulary.
Speaker B: Sir. Seek nikolay as a word. Ara meaning nipata. Note down. Galah meaning they sentence.
Speaker A: Right? So let's try to unt. But why do we do that? Meaning, why are we, you know, forming a sentence for a kapodega.
Speaker B: Memory. Maria.
Speaker A: Right. So that is the effect. So let's try to understand why. Because as we said, why is very important. Correct. Reason. Jannah. Triggering it. As Deepak said, it's long lasting now. Because we have to understand how our brains work. Let's start with a simple example. Take a. You met someone in the market, bought time. So you don't exactly recall the name. So Abgasi at Karu school. Kah nah school. Kaniya College. College. Kanye. So what your brain is doing. Your brain is associating one thing with the person's face. Her face is familiar. It went to the whole directory of all the people that you know. In college, in school. And then it's a good person, nurse. And amen. Now, huh? Now your brain is associating an Alphabet.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Person's face. So that is how a brain works. A brain works on associations.
Speaker B: Yes, sir. Right.
Speaker A: Right. Cheese. I think Deepak might have missed out. Was when you see a word, a new word, try to read the sentence and understand order to predict what can be its meaning. That's when your brain starts working. Right. Brain starts working. Then go to approximately at least. Correct?
Speaker B: Yes, sir.
Speaker A: Then you search for it, understand the meaning and then form one or two sentences. I would say two sentences. Now, these two sentences have to be related to your work or somewhere. You can use up Istamal karsoko as a sentence. Jahata Kosaki. Associate Kali. Work associate Kali. The next time, when that even the situation comes or when you have to use that word, it is very easy.
Speaker B: For your brain to recall it through proper connection.
Speaker A: Exactly. So that though it is easier for you to recall. Why? Because now your brain has formed an association with the word, with your work. Also work related. Doctor. Get a conversation. That's how it is formed. Yeah. That's how you should approach it. Right. All right.
Speaker B: So.
Speaker A: Yeah. Pronunciation, framing sentences, developing reading habits. All right, that's good. So framing sentences may, was there any concept discussed koi svopt as a coach?
Speaker B: Nature. Nature discussion.
Speaker A: All right. So let's see. All right. Okay. To like fresh start Karthi. Because already cover who. Yeah, but lab want to take a fresh sample because the occupity level at before two months and now it's been through three months. Let's take a fresh start. Right? What are the mistakes there? Or if you made any changes and improvements. There's already two to three coaching sessions have been conducted. So next, call me simple Karangay. So I'm not keeping it. So we. A generic topic. There are. Then we'll. Whatever topics we take, we try to take it like case studies, like we generate cases, we generate scenarios for which we'll make presentations or we'll have conversations. Right. Work related.
Speaker B: Oh, yes.
Speaker A: One topic I'm giving a little generic, but we want to apply it in our work life ticket. So it's a concept called storytelling. Storytelling. You know, stories. So this one is little different. How is it different?
Speaker B: What is.
Speaker A: When you say he's an effective storyteller, what do you want to say? Whatever he told, I was able to imagine it. Correct?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: So that is someone who is using, you know, one of what he's. What is this guy using? He's using the power of words, right? He is using voice modulation, right? Give that an intense scene. He will slow down his pace. Peak in a high, low, high pitched voice.
Speaker B: Yes, yes.
Speaker A: Attention. Dumb Sunday. So this is a few tricks and trips. So it has a combination of all of these things. So that's an effective storytelling, right? And also details. Attention to detail. Is it with words, can you make someone visualize?
Speaker B: Sometimes that is happens. Like involvement is more in a story. And effective words is there. Voice modulation is proper there. So sometimes we started to imagine that thing. Sir, whatever he's telling, things happen. Sir, started reading any novel. So after reading the whole thing running in our brain also situations. Also running evaluation. So I think just like that.
Speaker A: That's. That's. That's how powerful words are. The moment I say elephant.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Turan flashwa. Right? So you got an image of an element instantly.
Speaker B: Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Speaker A: Right. Now if I say the word, let's say lavender, right? The palaji is kadimagma. Lavender. Okay. Eliji kawarai kadimagmaka elijah.
Speaker B: So generally, chai bhagarami. Normally open kisibiko yad eli chi chai bulu or upcot.
Speaker A: Ask. Try to remember its taste. Can you do it simple. So you can almost. Almost taste it.
Speaker B: Yes, sir. Yes.
Speaker A: Just words. That's how powerful words are. So your brain cannot tell the difference between you imagining something and hearing something or reading something.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: For the brain, it is a reality. So if you can use the right words to make people visualize what you want, you're being very effective. That. And with research. So they try to compare. Why do people, I said, read Karthegun novels? Imagine. So they try to compare. Why do people love, you know, reading so much? So they map their brains. This is what they did, right? So they map their brains while reading a fictional novel. Like something like Harry Potter, right? When a new. A new, you know, character is being introduced. And dark look, haze this wavy short hair. Right? Something like that. Now they can. Now they try to correlate those patterns. Measure k while they were reading. When you're meeting someone new in reality. Yes, those were the same patterns. So you actually feel you're meeting someone new.
Speaker B: Value.
Speaker A: Actually just reading from book. That's how powerful words are. And if you don't use them so it's not to a benefit, then I think we are missing out on a lot.
Speaker B: Simple Murlab. I also remember one incident that I also read a novel of Chetan maga. That is five point someone. And after I watched the movie of three years. So really that time, the main thing, I remember that and all things which I read in that. So all is happening there. So total similarity is there, sir. So this is the actual example you gave, sir. Really?
Speaker A: So that's how we want to use words in the next call. So you have to tell me your fondest or more cherished childhood memory.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Right. You go in as much detail as possible. But now the catch is that you have to write it down and present you take this week because we will have the next call in the next week. Correct. So you have nearly five, six to seven days. Right. So write that down. Go in as much detail as possible. You know, tell it in the form of a story. Your. Your story. This is your childhood story.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Now why am I telling you to write it down? Because when you're writing it down, we will. You will get the mental space to use better words. Or let's say, what is the right word to describe Yehuata. Right. So you will try to seek will this word work? If you don't get it, you will search so that we also working on your vocabulary for your daily communication.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: And also when you write it down, that works as a sample for us to work on our grammar or sentence formation. You'll also see a difference between the for left, for example, you're able to write complete sentences, but when you're speaking, there are more mistakes. So we'll study all of that, try to correlate and we'll try to see how we can improve grammar. How we are going to approach it is we will take sentences that are grammatically incorrect and we'll keep eliminating them.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Right. So we'll just grab the mistakes that we are making and eliminate them. Right. And week on week, we have to make sure that we do not repeat them.
Speaker B: Yes, sir. Sure.
Speaker A: So that's grammar. So eliminating mistakes, vocabulary, as I said, you have to have that habit or extra pan. Second, if you're someone who always has a book and pen with himself, then write it down. Or technology. Right. There are so many apps for notes that can be synced online. So whatever device you are on, you will have the notes.
Speaker B: Yes, sir.
Speaker A: And we got to correlate. Right?
Speaker B: I want to ask one question, sir. What exactly can I do for the increasing the framing the sentences like that? Say, you told me that whenever you made the sentence, it's easy to meet the sentence with grammatically also. But when we started to speak, definitely many mistakes is there, sir, next present.
Speaker A: Karoge will be using that as a sample, too, you know, dissect it, dissect other mistakes that we are making. We pick sentences that you have written. Then I will give you surprise. I have an exercise, I will give it to you. Right? And that is, I be using zooms. We can use zoom. If I give end, use the recording and usi mesa, we'll do that exercise every week on week. We'll keep eliminating those errors and improve our language.
Speaker B: Definitely, sir.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: It should be fun, right? And I'm looking forward to hear your exercise. I get, I get the most interesting story. So this is one of my favorite exercises to start with.
Speaker B: Definitely, right.
Speaker A: It builds the connect with my participants also. So sometimes when I tell a story, if it is, you know, similar to what they have done. Right. So let's begin with that.
Speaker B: Thank you.
Speaker A: Right. Mukesh Abhito, it nai is Barma, Zada, bullra. Then we'll have more interactions that we wanted to set the stage a bit.
Speaker B: Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Speaker A: All right, Mukesh, thank you. Right. And make sure next week you have, you know, cat, this time I'm free a booker low session.
Speaker B: Definitely. Link has a link every time.
Speaker A: Merrill signature Ratana GG. That will be constant. Take it. You can always use this link to book a call.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Even if it is there, I put it in the mail so that people are able to recognize.
Speaker B: Definitely.
