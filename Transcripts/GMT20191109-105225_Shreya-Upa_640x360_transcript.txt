In India as you know there are many type of power generations like thermal plants, hydro plants and renewables we have solar, wind and so many things. In thermal plants we take by products as coal. In hydro plant we take by product as water. In wind we take by products. And wind and solar plants we take radiation of solar. And as you know wind and solar they both are quite natural plant because hydro we have to depend on rain. But wind and solar we don't have dependent like solar radiation windows. So we are in renewable we have wind and solar. In solar there are benefits. What I want to tell you the benefits are. Yes ma'am.
Speaker A: So abhi apnea muje kind of presentation. And the second presentation, apko kia difference.

Jessica, you said renewable energy. When you come solar it takes solar energy. Then to wind it takes wind as a raw material. You didn't mention all of these raw material in the previous presentation, right? I can again, you know, you can note down all the kinds of raw material and then again present for you know, a minute and you can or apka presentation or refine hojaga. Right? So this activity menapko Karvaya because it shows the importance of having your pointers. You don't need any aid. I can simply put pointers on my notebook pad, whatever or PPT and I can speak and to mira prime presentation. Right? So Yeham Mindful rena paragi agar Mary preparation coffee hair and agar Mary preparation. I think I should use the notes. When you gave a presentation, even in the workshop when you took out your notes.
Speaker B: After seeing that video, I can tell.
Speaker A: You saw the video.
Speaker B: It was recorded. It was recorded. I have not seen it.
Speaker A: Okay. Yeah.
Speaker B: No actually Sandeep said that he will send the video he has not sent. So after seeing that only I can tell whether I was stopping or not stopping in the.
Speaker A: Okay. Okay.
Speaker B: And one more thing. Audience here there is no audience. So there is no fear.
Speaker A: You're giving me the presentation as in so exactly. Like for example, if you are presenting to people who already are familiar with terminology, use Gardo unko defined Nakaro Unpe time based Nakaro. What other muje presentation there you'll have to define, right?
Speaker B: Yes ma'am.
Speaker A: Right. So you get that so correct audience. And for example you spent 1 second on. Good. Good evening. You spent 1 second on what is your topic? You spent 1 second on. You know my name is this. So Usmapke precious seconds proper yet actually whenever you present, right?
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Right. So. But yapkile kitna useful. How long. How many times in a. You know, in a year or in a month do you have to actually give presentations?
Speaker B: That is not dependent in a month we can give two, three in sometime in a month. Also we don't give. So that depends upon the. That depends on the condition. Whether they are making every schedule. Our juniors can learn something. So if required we have to give two three classes. If required. We are not able to give one class. Also if there is some more. If client required then we have to present. If clients require this one then we don't have to present it. Our management if early 2000 we can present them. So that is not. It is not fixed ma'am.
Speaker A: Right. So. But all of these presentations would be technical because it would depend on the work that you're doing, right?
Speaker B: Yes ma'am. Definitely right.
Speaker A: So is here because you already. You already know a lot of. I mean, you already know what you're doing. So problem. Yahape probably means egg, right? So. So. Abapi abhi mujebata. What would help you? Would preparation help you?
Speaker B: Would vocabulary words use? Nikata. Once we. Once we are not familiar with that words and so suddenly then don't come to our mind how to improve that actually vocabulary.
Speaker A: If you have people around you with whom you can speak in English.
Speaker B: No, we don't have.
Speaker A: You don't have people, right?
Speaker B: So what is the best solution for that?
