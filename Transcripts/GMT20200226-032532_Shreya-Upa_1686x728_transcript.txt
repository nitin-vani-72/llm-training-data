Speaker A: So you are there.
Speaker B: I'm sorry.
Speaker A: Yeah. So I was thinking. I was thinking whether you are there to attend this call or not.
Speaker B: Right. Right. I had just muted myself. I was just unmuting.
Speaker A: Okay. Yes.
Speaker B: So how was the workshop? I think we haven't talked, um, after the workshop, have we?
Speaker A: No, we did not speak.
Speaker B: So how was it? How was the presentation?
Speaker A: Presentation went good.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Workshop was effective.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Yes. Is a very, I would say precise and effective communicator.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: And he believe and he explains what is to be brought out during presentation and what should be the structure.
Speaker B: Correct.
Speaker A: Yeah. So my presentation went good as he is, as he had mentioned.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: So according to him, it went well.
Speaker A: He. When he gave feedback, he mentioned that structure was good. The words came out clean and words in few words I had used, those were like new words. One point you mentioned that I need to work on presentation. Yeah. Presence. So presence.
Speaker B: Right.
Speaker A: See this midterm presentation I spoke about trekking.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Because the topic we had to choose and we had to bring out the points which should be original.
Speaker B: Right? Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker A: So I had not done. I had not worked on presentation before the workshop. In the workshop only I did this practice to give the presentation. Yes. So I spoke on tracking.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Yeah. And only, uh, when I. So you mentioned when you speak of the good words I had used. Like. Like the. I had shown images also during presentation. So. So expression. I mean face facial expressions should also talk about what I'm talking.
Speaker B: Correct. Yes.
Speaker A: That. That was the feedback from me.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Work on this.
Speaker B: So presence in the sense just facial expressions or anything else as well. So did he talk to you about body language or voice modulation or any. Anything else?
Speaker A: This body language was okay. He did not talk about. He talked about voice modulation. And this means emotions should also be on the face while using some special words.
Speaker B: Correct. So could you give me an example?
Speaker A: Like surroundings mean. The rupin pass track is blazed with beautiful valleys, dense forest and gushing waterfalls. Okay. So when I'm dance. Okay. So from my face it should be expressing what I'm talking about. And when I'm saying gushing. Okay. So yeah. So people should feel. Yes. What is gushing?
Speaker B: Okay. So do you mind saying it like that? Could you repeat that sentence with the modulation?
Speaker A: So european pass is blazed with triple valleys, dense forest and rushing waterfalls.
Speaker B: So according to me there was no difference between your first and your second sentence. Did you feel any difference?
Speaker A: No.
Speaker B: So could we. Could we put on the video for this? It would be helpful. Hello. Yeah. Okay. So there is one more way that you can do this. Maybe, you know, if you do this without gestures, it would. It would be a little difficult. So maybe when you say dense forests, you could act it out as well, not too much, but you can simply say so. Okay, I'll say so. The rupen pass is filled with dense forests, gushing waterfalls and beautiful. I'm sorry. Beautiful valley.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: Beautiful valleys. Right. So how you can do it? So the rupen pass is filled with beautiful valleys.
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: Forests and gushing waterfalls. Can you try?
Speaker A: I'm good at that.
Speaker B: I know, I know. You don't have to take such huge actions. Now I am seeing. That is my style you can find, right? So maybe that is. That is some way you can practice. That is how you can get more modulation. I'm pretty sure work presentations don't involve that much, but maybe sometimes when you have to, since you're in marketing, maybe you have to talk to customers about your system.
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: And maybe if they know that you're passionate about what you're talking about, maybe they'll be convinced. I mean, they will be convinced. Maybe they'll be convinced, right? So, okay, let's. Let's do this with one of your. One of your work conversations rather than this presentation. This is an isolated event, right? The customer conversations you would be having are on more. Are more a part of your work. So could you. Typical conversation you have with a client or a customer, please?
Speaker A: Pardon?
Speaker B: So could you give me an example of a conversation you have with customer or a client?
Speaker A: Okay, see, I mean, sales. So mainly there are two activities. One is order inflow. Second is the dispatch and collection. Okay, yeah. So, order inflow, I would say when most of our customers are government PSU companies. Okay. So they delay in placing the orders. Okay, so most of the time, I follow up with them, and I use this sentence. This purchase order we were expecting last month, but still it is not placed on us. So we request you to kindly place the purchase order at the earliest, or I don't say no. At the earliest I mention them. Kindly place the purchase order within this month. Within two weeks. Yes. So there I do that. I have to explain in a way that she understand. Yes. It is urgent, and it is required to be placed on the company, like LNT, within time. Okay. They should not delay further. Right. Okay, so I have to add some words like, if you don't place this purchase order, there will be delay in supplying the material. There will be difficulties in purchasing the material on time. So, ma'am, you know, there is type testing involved. It takes time. So it takes time. So therefore, I repeat this, that there will be significant delay in supplying the material and your project schedule may or differ. So I request you to place the purchase order within two weeks.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: So that is your conversation.
Speaker A: Yeah. So here.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Yeah. So here, when I'm saying it is, note that I want this purchase order in the first. I want to convince the customer he should place the purchase order first. Otherwise his project schedule will appear delayed. Yes, of course.
Speaker B: So I get that. I understand completely. So now you have to convince them to place the order early, right?
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: Could we have a small role play? Let's see how you typically do it. Right. So let me be the person that you call for. Um, you know, so I'll give you excuses and you can, you know, again, is it fine?
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: Okay, let's try. Uh, so you. Let's say you're calling me.
Speaker A: So.
Speaker B: Hello, Manish.
Speaker A: Hello.
Speaker B: Hello. So how are you, Manish?
Speaker A: I'm doing good, thank you. How are you?
Speaker B: Right, I'm good. I'm good. So you have called about a purchase order that was need. That needed to be placed.
Speaker A: Yes, I called you two times. Yes, you told me that. You told me that you would discuss last week. But unfortunately you could not discuss. And thanks. Now you are discussing in this week. I was expecting call from you.
Speaker B: Right, right. So sorry. I was a little busy, so I couldn't. But yeah, please go ahead. So what is it that you wanted to know?
Speaker A: See, this purchase order we are talking about is for the equipment. You want this equipment for installation on board your ship. And we. I have already conveyed this to you. When we were discussing about this tender you had sent the inquiry. You had mentioned that you wanted this equipment to be supplied in March 2021. But now this is already February 2020. And we had mentioned in our offer that it will require 18 weeks. Sorry, 18 months for supplying this item. Yeah. So how it can be possible. Already we were expecting this purchase order to be placed by December 2019. Yes. And 219 or earlier. So that we. We were. We had planned that we will start the activities and complete the order on time. But now, ma'am, we are already in February. And now if I compare only, I will have only effectively twelve months. This is February. You will be placing the order in March. So it will very, very difficult for lnt supplying this item in March 2021. So now I want. I request you to place the. This purchase order by tomorrow.
Speaker B: So, Manish, thank you so much for, you know, sort of telling me about the whole situation, but the thing is, there's a lot of, there are a lot of processes in sort of even placing the order with you. So let me get back to you as to how we can do this. So tomorrow would anyways be a little difficult, even short notice, even for us. But let me get back to you. Is that all right?
Speaker A: Last time we spoke, you mentioned that you had submitted the proposal for placing this purchase order. And. Yeah. And this was at the approval from the last authority. So this was supposed to be completed last week only. And after you get, after you receive the approval. I know for last, our inquiries. After you receive the approval from your highest authority, you place the purchase order within two or three days. Now, may I know what is the stage, you mentioned that last week was almost at the stage of approval, but if you don't mind, please tell me where is the difficulty, why this purchase order is being delayed and if it is delayed further, then I will require extra time for supplying the item.
Speaker B: Correct? Correct. So as you said that last week, it was almost about the last approval. So I am the. That the last authority is a bit higher on the ladder, so they require a little bit of time to go through it since it's such a huge order for us as well. They need a bit of time. So I guess they haven't been able to get around to it, which is why it's been time. But in case there the extra time is needed, I guess we can, we can work something, right?
Speaker A: No. May I know or kindly late, kindly update me on this. May you update me on this tomorrow or what is the stage? And I will write an email to you on this discuss. I will. In this email, I will add the point that LnT requires extra time for supplying the material. And this extra four months extra means if material is required in March 2021, l and D will not be supplying in March 2021, it will be in July 2021. So I write this to you, kindly give approval on this before you place the purchase order. And this is to be the purchase order.
Speaker B: Okay. All right. No worries. So this was good. This was good, actually. So is this how it normally goes?
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: I understand it's frustrating and I may be wrong, but I think it showed a little. You were like, why don't you do it? So, but that is, that is okay since it is not something that we need to work on. So. So, okay. When you said I want and then you changed it to immediately I request.
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: At one point, make sure that that doesn't happen because like, okay, I want. You want me to do something. So those words that I know.
Speaker A: So when we talk to customer. When we talk to customer, we know that there, I don't use this word. I use request or kindly place the purchase order words. Because if I use some other word, okay. My relationships with them, okay. Be different. Can go in bad direction. So I don't want that.
Speaker B: So as far as I know, your words were correct. So you're right. You can first of all use less words. Okay. So too many sentences here. So we'll try it again with less words. Not today.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: But maybe, maybe the next time you call. Because this is only our 6th call, I think. So you have two more calls. So we'll do it. We'll do it. But we'll do it. I think this, this situation is good. So we'll keep this situation and we'll try it with less words. Okay. So you, you want us to, like, you want the client to place order with you. It's not happening. So your reasoning was good. It was really good because, you know, it sort of placed a pressure on the client, right? So. So what you can do, this do is when you said I called you two times, so you can emphasize the two part, you know, I have made the effort. It shows them that you made the effort. I actually called you twice. Something like that. So not too much, too much stress on the word too. But you can highlight it, you know, when you speak. I actually called you twice, ma'am, so I understand you were busy. So you didn't get back to me. And you can give one more thing is that when you know it will be difficult for. So what you can do is you can give the. You can give the client also the reasoning. So instead of saying it will be very difficult for LNT, you can add that, ma'am. The thing is that you would receive the order late, right? Because we need to get. We need to procure the material and there's a lot of processes involved and you know that it's going to be too tedious. So you. So I request you that please, you know, please place the order at the earliest possible. And see, we are already in February. It's already been very late.
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: So you can stress on these. Now this is how I would talk, you know, how would you stress words? Your personal style would be different from mine. So you could find it out. You find it.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: So let's, let's practice. Let's practice this again with stressing the right words, okay. Because in this conversation you did not stress the words. Now I need you to stress the words. Right. For example, I told you stress the word two called two times.
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: Right. So. And you said, oh, you know, we wanted it to be actually placed in December 2019, but it's already February 2020, and you needed it March 2021. So you understand. So you can stress the right words, but that's on you. What you want to stress, what makes the most effect on your client. Because you know your client.
Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know.
Speaker B: So, sounds good.
Speaker A: Okay. So next call, we will. I'll present this to you in video. Okay. Yeah. And I will work on this.
Speaker B: Yeah. And also what you. What I want you to do is show them the logic behind. If you're logical, then they would be more easily. Because we assume that we are working with very intelligent people who understand logic. Right. So show them the logic of why you need them. Need the order quickly.
Speaker A: Yeah.
Speaker B: And it should make sense to them. Right?
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: So these two things. So less words, logic and.
Speaker A: Okay, okay, so, uh, that's. That's, uh. I'll work on this. I was through my midterm, uh, report.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Maybe talk about this.
Speaker B: Yes, yes, let's do that. I also have. Do you want to share the screen or shall I?
Speaker A: Please share.
Speaker B: Let me put up. Now we can put up the video. Okay. You're sharing.
Speaker A: Articulation, accuracy. So prijins, you have to guide me how to improve.
Speaker B: Yes. So grammar pretty much is cool, except for sometimes when you don't know what to say, your sentences go way haywire. But apart from that, grammar is something that. So you understand these four capabilities, right? Thinking, articulation, accuracy is mainly grammar and presence. Presence, of course, is. Ashish has already told you. So you understand these four capabilities, right?
Speaker A: Yes. So accuracy and presence. I have to. On these two aspects.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: I have to put more efforts in these two.
Speaker B: And I've given you a very high target. Thinking, though you will reach. You're already very high on thinking. I think I'm supposed to. You are already two c. You're supposed to go to three a. So once you like, you know, once you show me the logic of what you're speaking and the purpose, you're done. So three a is what you. Three a, you'll reach very easily. Yes. Articulation. Also you're there. Accuracy and presence. Accuracy. Me, Khali, you to take care of your articles and your sentences.
Speaker A: Okay?
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: Right. So do you read newspapers, right? Or you read those trekking blogs?
Speaker A: Nowadays I'm not able to read anything.
Speaker B: Oh, very busy.
Speaker A: Oh, yes. I have some family conditions. So I am busy from seven to eleven every day.
Speaker B: Wait. Seven to eleven after going home.
Speaker A: I'm saying seven. I start from home. I go back and I am at home around seven or 07:30 p.m.? Okay. Yes. After I'm busy with my kid till 11:00 p.m.
Speaker B: Your kid?
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: So do you guys play or do you teach him?
Speaker A: No, he is two years old and I have to take his career.
Speaker B: Okay. Oh, all right. Maybe your wife is working and would miss.
Speaker A: Pardon.
Speaker B: I guess just give me a minute. Okay. No worries. So is your wife working so that you take care of.
Speaker A: No, she's not more. She passed away.
Speaker B: Oh, I'm so sorry.
Speaker A: So, uh. Yeah, so it is, uh. Almost one year she passed away. So that's what, uh. With my present family situations, I'm not able to read. I'm not able to do any extra thing.
Speaker B: No, no. So taking care of him is. May I know his name please?
Speaker A: His name is Arjun. Arjun Vadhavani.
Speaker B: Oh, right.
Speaker A: So Arjun.
Speaker B: Yeah, I guess Arjun takes a lot of time. So where does he. So he. I understand. He has school in the morning. So where does he stay after he comes back from school?
Speaker A: See, he's. He's two years and he goes to daycare complex school from eleven to seven every day. So in the morning, my mother and my younger sister, they are there. They take care and they leave him at daycare. Because my sister, she's also working.
Speaker B: Okay. So they drop him off. Okay.
Speaker A: Yes. In the evening I have to be there and take his care. Because this daycare works till 730.
Speaker B: Okay. Right. So. And do you. So do you cook and everything for him?
Speaker A: No, no, no. I know cooking. But my mother, she does that.
Speaker B: Right. So how do you. How would you be practicing? How would you be working on this then?
Speaker A: I will. I will mean, I would say on my own. I am trying to improve. Like when I. When I bring out the sentences then I. Analysis. I do analysis. Yeah. What went wrong? Which word I could use and what grammar went wrong.
Speaker B: Okay, so any other doubts you have with the reports?
Speaker A: No. That's pretty. Okay. I know. I do work in these two areas.
Speaker B: And you want me. Do you want me to send you your presentation?
Speaker A: Which presentation?
Speaker B: The midterm. You don't have it, right? It's not a part of this report. Do you need your presentation to work on and to see what went wrong?
Speaker A: Yes, please.
Speaker B: Okay, so I'll send you the presentation. And so. And in that case, I mean, since you take care of Arjun and I think, well, all your time is taken up through that. So how. Where did you get the time to write the blog? Not the blog, the article.
Speaker A: So, no, I was doing this when doing this after 11:00 p.m. Or some. Okay. When I traveling, when I am traveling by local train or by some public transport, I was writing this on, in my mobile. Mobile. And one day I use my laptop to call it all the paragraphs.
Speaker B: Okay. Oh, you can. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, that must have taken a lot of time.
Speaker A: See, blog still I don't finalize because I'm not getting time. So blog, I have to conclude and publish on one blog. Website.
Speaker B: Yes, that's. I understand because you haven't got the time to finalize things. And blog is something that used to be writing regularly. So you have to think about that before.
Speaker A: See, I. I will say, I know that when I write, I can write good things. Good things mean the. I'm used to be a good writer at college, at college, during my school time, whether it is Hindi language or English language. So I will pursue this. I'm going to write blogs. I'm going, if everything goes good, I will write a book also.
Speaker B: Wow. I would really be glad to go through your blog and your book. Yeah, that would be, that would be amazing.
Speaker A: So.
Speaker B: Waiting for it. So in that case, okay, please work on this and I'll speak to you again maybe this week or next week, because I think next week is the last, last week of your coaching.
Speaker A: There are three workshops remaining.
Speaker B: Three workshops.
Speaker A: Three workshops. I'm right. Yeah, we have. We are given dates. Tomorrow there is workshop and there are two more workshops.
