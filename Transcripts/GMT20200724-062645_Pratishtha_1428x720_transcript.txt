Speaker A: Subrata your mail around the feedback.
Speaker B: Yes, yes.
Speaker A: On the presentation. So let's talk about that. What all did you identify? Were there more points?
Speaker B: So actually, I would like to know that I have find out some points that I mentioned and I just want to just build up my capability in these areas.
Speaker A: Right.
Speaker B: Okay. So that is what I think it will be better if we discuss today.
Speaker A: Sure, we can do that. And I, while I was reading this email that you had sent, I was also, again, watching your videos. That video recording that I sent you, I also rewatched it once so that I can share my feedback. So if there is anything that I would like to add to whatever you have just mentioned. So whatever you have just mentioned is all. Okay. I mean, I agree with all the points that you have written. What I can do is I can share a couple of tricks or, you know, step changes that we can do here. So for example, when, like you said in the very first sentence, or the very first point was that it was very fast and the listener may miss some points. Right now it isn't that your pace is very fast. Okay, Asanaki. The pace is so fast that I'm not able to catch it. It's not like that. Right? Though we can always include some pauses in it. Pauses are always a better option. But why you feel that it is fast is because there are a lot of details that you're sharing and there's no time for reflection in between. So it's like when you started, you said the context, very sorry that this has happened, and the batch was already checked and all of that. But then the moment you started giving solutions that, you know, add monomer at this particular hour or whatever, solutions were there. So there were three to four different solutions and they came after one another in a. In a fast speed. So you are sharing a lot of details. The details have some actions that the person also has to do. Right. So if I am someone who has to use something that you are saying, I'll. I'll either be writing it somewhere or I'll. I'll be trying to remember. I'll try to remember it. What you're saying. Right. So if there are many details, then you need to slow down and structure it better so that people remember. Right now what is happening is the details that you presented and the solutions that you presented are merged together.
Speaker B: Okay?
Speaker A: So there has to be a distinction.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: So if there is no distinction, then it becomes difficult because I am receiving all the data all together. Right.
Speaker B: So it's better if. If I classify, uh, in two, uh, contents, like two paragraphs. Like, I am just, uh, telling the, this may be the problems. And in the, after taking the pause, I am telling, yeah, that these are the problems you can think.
Speaker A: Exactly. So, labeling is something that will become important for you here. See, when we present something and we don't really have a ppt here, the ppt make out there, you have something on screen, right? So the people are able to see those words. So if they don't remember everything that you have said, at least they'll remember those, you know, phrases or words or numbers that you had written there. Okay, so PPT is like a visual tool. Now, if you don't have that, you will have to do that work of the PPT as well. So you will have to categorize, like you said, that, you know, categorize the problem. So you tell that this is the problem. This might be the reason, and you would want to keep highlighting those keywords. So, for example, what was one of the problems that was discussed in the case? Give me, remind me of one of the problems.
Speaker B: The problem was the viscosity was very high in the batch. So now what I told the cause, the cause of that particular problem was the addition rate. The addition rate was, it was added very fast.
Speaker A: It was added.
Speaker B: So then the solution will be, you just make sure you are adding the monomer at a slower rate.
Speaker A: Correct. Now, here what you can do is labeling. What I'm saying. Labeling becomes important here, right? Bucketing and labeling. This is how you do it. So you tell them that the first problem is ABC. So in this case, the first problem is high viscosity. Okay? Then you say that there can be two reasons for these, for this problem. Okay, so Jobi apk reason, sir. So what you're doing is you are labeling. So a picture the problem. Then the one, the first problem, then the causes, then two causes. You said there can be two causes. So one and two, right? And then you said that. Now what you can do to solve this? Okay, so now we label one solution, right? There are three things that you can do to solve this particular problem. A, b, and c. Okay? So when you are presenting something like this and labeling each thing, solution. So people are able to very easily bucket it in their head and they would remember those things that you would want them to remember or solution. Maybe agar USA related actions can be that you add it, add the monomer at a slower rate. Right? Now, this is a solution. This is a generic solution. Whenever the viscosity is high, one of the probable solutions can be to add the monomer at a slower rate. Okay. But in this particular case, what can he do? Okay, what will he have to do in this particular batch? So is there a Jesse apnea 4.54.25k aspas ad currency? Right. So here you can say that. Now your key action to solve this problem would be in the next batch, add the monomer at 4.25 hours. Okay, so now how you have structured it for the person, it is easier for him to remember very easily. With flow chart Bhattachayaga problem causes solution. My key action. So sae harm problem structure they.
Speaker B: Okay, so that will be very easy to memorize and to follow for the audience.
Speaker A: Exactly. So the whole idea is that when you don't have a PPT and you want people to remember something, your structuring of your thoughts would become, you know, critical over there. How you structured your thoughts and then present that is very critical there. So you'll have to take care of what point goes where. Is it easily able to, you know, is it easily visualizable? Are people able to make that flowchart in their head or not? So the only feedback that I was able to think of while I was listening to this was that there were many details that you were presenting, but all of them were mixed together. So if we could have bucketed and labeled them separately so that I could have remembered it better.
Speaker B: Yes, and probably that I can correlate with that. You showed some samples in the last IPL meeting. So I think it was like the first one. First or second sample.
Speaker A: Right, right.
Speaker B: I just correlating these things.
Speaker A: However, the three C was done. Like you have also mentioned in your, you know, the feedback that you have sent that this three C format was followed is just that we are going a step ahead than three c. Three c. Simply context, content, call to action. Okay. Now in the content as well, how would you structure the content part itself? That's what we are discussing about. So what we discussed today, what we discussed today is more than three c. Three c is the first level. This is the second level.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Okay. So like we had all always talked about who, why, how, what tool, right. In that tool, before introducing that tool, I told you that the three key elements of any presentation or conversation is attention, retention and comprehension. So in your particular presentation, comprehension was very well done because you gave all the details, everything was very specific. So. But you also mentioned those numbers. So I remember those numbers. So comprehension was done well, it's just that there were too many things to comprehend. That's the reason why retention became a problem.
Speaker B: Okay?
Speaker A: Right. Attention was also there because you were sharing a solution that would have helped me somewhere. So my value was very well set.
Speaker B: Okay. So I think in the retention part, I think I need to work on.
Speaker A: Yes, yes. So we can do one thing. We still have 15 minutes, right? So this particular option that I shared with you, this particular way of structuring thoughts that I've shared with you, can we take up another case? Any situation, something similar where you're presenting something to your manager or, you know, any other person, maybe marketing team or any other team, and we can try this structuring bit a little bit better. Who, why, how, what lake.
Speaker B: Actually, to present something, I need slide. This is my problem, actually, without slide, I think how to. How to move ahead. And I am. I am talking good rate, but, you know, in a proper rate, but in the middle or after some time. So I just forward that format. So I just want to focus on that part.
Speaker A: So do one thing. Do one thing right now. You don't have the luxury of slides, right? Do a quick analysis. Okay? So let's say whatever. Let me share my screen. Whatever. Whatever topic you select. For example, you selected a case, okay. In a particular case, you have to present something. Okay. Okay. So jabab, slide, banana bathoge. What would be on those slides? Okay, so keep writing it here in a bullet point. Okay. So you say that you'll talk about the background. Okay. In the background, you will say you will also add the purpose.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Of this meeting or conversation. Okay. Now this is done. Then you start adding the content. Okay. Content may point a pele aga, serbia, fiddiaga, whatever it is. Finally, there would be some sort of proposal. Conclusion, joby, basic flow, hamara. And finally, there would be an action plan, right? This is how your slides would be, okay?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Bullet point. So if we take a case right now, I'll be able to help you better. So give me a case. Any situation where you have to present.
Speaker B: Something, some problem solving.
Speaker A: Okay, great. So tell me a problem that you're solving currently or anything that you have done in the past.
Speaker B: Recently we processed our polymer batch where in the finished product, we have observed the drying iteration. That is, we need some drying time. The paint should dry at a particular time, but it is drying is very slow. Actually, in that particular batch, it should not give back because we already chandrased it. And it is a well established formula. So basically we need to. And then we gave some proposal. What all are the critical parameters that that may be the better culprit for the particular problem.
Speaker A: Right? Now, if this is the case, right. You are presenting, let's say whatever your analysis you have done, okay? So slow drying time. Whereas it should not be the case that the paint should not take so much time to dry out. Okay. Now this is a case and you have done some brainstorming in it. Kikiya hai kyanaya problem apnea nikalki tunke analysis. Kia now tell me if this is something that you have to present to your manager. Manager Kui present Karogena.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Or Kisiko present Karogi manager. Kui Karogi manager. You know. So let's discuss Tamara Tungya bolted. Who? Then why? Then how? And then what? Okay, so tell me who is your listener? Tell me a little bit about your manager, Kyakiya Chi Saungi. Who may have Soth sat manager. Right. We say that, okay. What? Who this person is, right? What would be his expectation?
Speaker B: Expectation. What is the problem and what is the problem? Solution.
Speaker A: So he would definitely want to know the solution problem. But he would want to know why is this problem happening.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Problem care. But he would want a solution. Right? These were the two expectations that he would have. Okay. So now you know that you have to add these two things, right?
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Now. Now tell me, based on all your analysis, could you find why it was happening? Could you find the solution to it?
Speaker B: Yes. Because the molecular weight of the particular batch was less.
Speaker A: Okay. All right. Okay. And why did it happen that the molecular base was less? Did somebody something in the wrong proportion?
Speaker B: No, because it was at that particular batch, it was processed at the slightly low temperature. And which results the delaying in the process. So actually they processed the batch in a longer time to attend the specification.
Speaker A: So less molecular base happened.
Speaker B: Because it's not base. It's what? What?
Speaker A: Wait, wait 1 second. Okay. So it happened because it. It was processed at low temperature and.
Speaker B: For a longer time. For longer time? Yes.
Speaker A: Okay. Let's, let's go one more level deep. Okay. Why did this happen? Why was this process at a lower temperature and for longer time? Why?
Speaker B: I didn't get you. This is a.
Speaker A: I got it. Now, what we are doing here is a quick why y analysis, okay? So it's like going to the root of the problem. Okay? So less molecular weight. It was processed at low temperature and longer time. Why was it processed at low temperature and longer time? As a q here as a q.
Speaker B: Because, uh, the initial, uh, specification was not attained.
Speaker A: Very good.
Speaker B: That's the specification that we need. It does not attend for that particular batch. So there may be, uh, contamination with the raw material.
Speaker A: Uh, are there two reasons here?
Speaker B: Uh, initial, uh, specification was not attained. That is why they processed for a long, longer time just to get the specification. And that initial speculation was not attained at a particular time because the raw material contamination was there.
Speaker A: Okay. Okay, got it. So we have four levels of good raw material contamination. Okay, good. Now this is like a viva analysis, like raw material contamination. So as you go deep, you will be able to reach to the root cause. Okay. Now, as a presenter, you have to identify what is the level that you would want to talk about. Kitna level tag.
Speaker B: Fourth level is. Okay.
Speaker A: So this is because your managers may want to, you know, they may keep asking you. So if you present from the very root cause, then the whole thing is, I mean, they satisfied the answer.
Speaker B: Raw material contamination was identified by some analytical tool that we used in our R and D. That is actually the how we reached to the solution, how we identified. So we identified the solution versus the proof. The proof of the proof, you can say that is that we identified. We analyzed the raw material in our lab scale, in our r and t.
Speaker A: I think also something that the manager would want to know who, why analysis. Now tell me that if this is the information that's given in front of you, it may say kyake information, leave out Karaktang and we filter out anything. Okay, so how will you leave this discussion or presentation with the manager? Now tell me. Let's now, uh, arrange our thoughts.
Speaker B: Actually, first I will tell the problem happened in the production scale.
Speaker A: What was the problem? Right.
Speaker B: Problem. So basically background why I am presenting.
Speaker A: So you are talking about the case problem itself, key issue. And then why are you presenting? So you're presenting for the solution.
Speaker B: Solution.
Speaker A: Okay. Now your solution may jobi apnea solution. Nikala hai, do you need any help from the manager here? Do you want him to do anything?
Speaker B: No, no. I am just.
Speaker A: No, no. Right. Okay. So why are you.
Speaker B: I can say like this that we identified this and I just need your approval. Okay. Just means you just align with me whether he's aligned with me or not with my professor.
Speaker A: So those things is a while ape Q present career manager kakoi approval. So the purpose would become that for approval, I'm presenting this. Okay. Yafirapco manager align Karna so that for his information, you are talking about, right alignment or tisla yosakta ki bai. Possibly you have been able to find out a very specific cause. This is raw material contamination, right? Abhi apolyoki? Raw material contamination. Let's just imagine that. So that's the reason why you are presenting some a solution like this. So that we can solve or you know, set the course, right?
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Right. So you'll have to identify. It depends on what you are presenting. What is the probable purpose of presenting? So here it's only alignment, right? So it's all right. So alignment. Why batadiya? Why kibat ka bhataogi?
Speaker B: What?
Speaker A: So what? All would be the points that you would talk about what is our solution? Right?
Speaker B: And the raw material contamination was there. And I will also. I will also discuss how I reached to the conclusion, how I reached to the root cause that the fourth level, I will start from first level to fourth level.
Speaker A: And finally, what are we doing? So what is the solution or last map solution plan kahe. Right. Right. Abhiyagara presentation. Banate. Ppt. Banate those maybe. Right?
Speaker B: Correct.
Speaker A: Correct. Now ak Kirke patcho nachalu kurto. You don't need a ppt now you have these five points in front of you.
Speaker B: Okay?
Speaker A: Okay. So are you able to now understand agar ppt banana time. This is one of the fastest way that you can make a ppt.
Speaker B: Yes, yes. So may I start?
Speaker A: Yes, you can if you want to. Now Ismadarakna subrata key hamko bucket Karna. Now you want people, your manager to remember what you are saying. So wherever you want him to remember, bucket things down. Problem hair is solution hair iske char causes. When you use these numbers, two problems, three solution four causes people remember it better.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: So 1 second I'll stop the recording and start it once again and then you can begin.
