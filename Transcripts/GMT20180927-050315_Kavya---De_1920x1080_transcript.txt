Speaker A: That's true. Amazing. So I'm happy that there was a key learning that you could take away from the workshop. Now, quick feedback for you. I have spoken to you on the call. We interacted during the workshop. I also went through your presentation on the workshop day, on the final day. What happened to the energy level of the last day?
Speaker B: Sorry.
Speaker A: So what happened to your energy levels on the last day? During your presentation?
Speaker B: I suddenly started to feel out of breath. I don't know if it was because of the tension or if. I don't know, but I started to run out of breath.
Speaker A: So what could be the possible reason? So one, you're saying, was it the stress? What could be the reason for the stress?
Speaker B: Maybe I felt I was a little unprepared. Generally, I have a lot of time before my presentations, and then I even time it. I do a mock presentation to know if I'm right on time or if I'm falling short of time so that I can cut, or if I'm actually having lot of time and not using it. That was one thing that I felt could be a reason for my stress.
Speaker A: All right, point taken. So we will give you enough time for understanding tools, concepts, and preparing for our calls. So during these eight weeks, what I'm going to start with today is the thinking concept within communication. Okay, we're going to discuss two course. One is the mind maps, and the second tool is the BBE concept.
Speaker B: BBE.
Speaker A: So often, I'll take you through both of them. So often, what happens is that when we asked to present upon a topic, when we asked to join a call, when we are asked to respond to an email, we have a lot of information. But a lot of information does not mean that all the information is relevant. Having lots of information and finding relevant information out of that are two different things. And being able to communicate the relevant information in an effective manner is a third aspect to it. One is gathering information. Second is structuring information. Third is effectively communicating the information.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Yeah. Now, the first two that we will discuss today is called a mind map. So, whenever you want to prepare on a topic, there is a concept called mind map, which is used by most of the effective communicators across the world. So if you ever get a chance to read upon what mind maps are, take time, read upon it. But to explain mind maps to you in a simple manner which you can use in your day to day life, do you have any calls or presentations coming up?
Speaker B: I do have a call coming up today, but I don't have to prepare for it. It's like we discuss and then, and there we, if we have any inputs, we give it to them. Or else, if we have to check internally, then we'll tell them that I will have to check and then.
Speaker A: Sure. Then you can use the second tool, which we will discuss beginning, body, end, and see these tools you will become an expert at with continual practice. So it's not that, you know, today we discuss the tool and then suddenly you're an expert at it. You need to practice it. There will be times when you'll be overloaded with work. You wouldn't get time to practice it. But make your best effort, give it your best shot to try practicing these tools. Because as practicing the tools, you'll reach a point in the next two months where you won't have to put too much time into preparation. Your mind will go into an autopilot where it directly starts thinking on the basis of these tools. So let's start with our first tool, which is called mind map.
Speaker B: Okay?
Speaker A: All right. Now, mind map is used to gather information. So everything that is there which is available to you. All right, so let me share screen you. Are you able to see the screen?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Now, within a mind map, you have a central, main theme or topic which you put at the center of the page. So whenever we make a mind map for a topic or a subject or a presentation, any form of communication could be an email, could be a conference, main subject at the center. Then we use dimensions of that subject around the main theme. And then for each dimension we add further points. So let's do an example. Let's say I ask you to speak on a topic called pension pens.
Speaker B: Okay?
Speaker A: So you put pen pens over here in the center. Now, what things can you discuss about pens? Let's say you need to write up, you need to representation around pens. So what all aspects can you cover?
Speaker B: The types of pens, ball point.
Speaker A: Excellent. So here in dimension one, you'll write types of pencil, and then you throw for arrows. So you'll write ballpoint pens, ink pens, gel pens, etc. Etc. Etcetera. What other dimensions can you cover?
Speaker B: Pens, maybe how they are made. I think that again falls under types. How the different types.
Speaker A: So no different for different types.
Speaker B: Sorry, your voice broke.
Speaker A: The manufacturing process would be different. Different for how they are made. Will deal with how they are manufactured. So you can put that in dimension.
Speaker B: To mention two.
Speaker A: What other dimensions can you think of?
Speaker B: And maybe like we can talk about different cases where different kinds are used. For example, markers are also types of pens or so.
Speaker A: Yeah. Or maybe, can I say that users or utility?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: The dimension three comes as users or utility. Over here you put for presentations, for writing, et cetera, et cetera. Any other dimension you can think of.
Speaker B: Timeline. Earlier they used to write with the feathers and all. Now. So then I think, then came the ink pens and then ballpoint and then gel point, so we can.
Speaker A: Excellent. Excellent. So this way you go on putting as many dimensions as I, as you can think of. So this is one of our participants solved it. So he said, I'll start with users, markets, innovation, history, aesthetics, writing types, cost. So all that we're doing is you take the central idea, you take different dimensions around the central idea. What, where, when, why, how? Then you write more points or how many of the points you know about it. So when you look at this one piece of paper, you have all the information that. About this topic on one piece of paper.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Yeah. So this is called mind map tool, which is the first step in preparation of gathering information. So now I know this is all the information that I already have on this topic.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Now comes the important part, which is the next two, which is called BBE two. It simply stands for beginning, body, end.
Speaker B: Okay?
Speaker A: Yeah. Now, before I get into the beginning, body, end tool, I need to understand, who am I making this presentation to? Who am I having to call with? Who am I writing email to? Who is going to read this? Who is my audience?
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: So here you cover aspects such as, is this person senior to me? Because when you're communicating with someone who's senior to you, your style may change. You need to understand what is he looking for in this conversation? What is his interest? Is he high? D is or c? If he's a high d, he'll be looking for outcomes. He wants action plan, timeline, if he's high, c, he wants data points. If he's high. I may be looking for a very ashy representation of what I'm going to speak about. If it's your peer group, how much do you already know about the subject? If it's subordinates, how much do they know about you? How are the relationships? Because all of these factors will, will impact how you're going to communicate with them.
Speaker B: Okay?
Speaker A: Now, once you're clear with who you're going to be communicating with, decide what is important for the person. So now from the mind map, where you have a flurry of information, you pick up points which are relevant to the audience. Often we pick up points which we feel are important. Now, we need to stop you know, looking at what we feel is important and start analyzing what's important for the receiver. So there you mark. These are the points which are important for my receiver.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: And once you have filtered this information. Now we start with the BBE tool. In the BBE tool, whenever I begin a conversation, it is very important to set the context and tell the listener, why are we having this call? Why are we having this presentation? Why am I writing this email? When I do an email writing tool with you? Maybe next week or next to next week, it works on the same principles, so the principle of communication will always remain the same, understanding who I'm speaking to, what's important for that person, and to start with the why in mind, why are we having this conversation? So, today, when I started the call, did you realize I started the why. So I'm going to do two tools with you. But why is very important, because if you want to be effective, then your audience needs to understand why is this conversation happening. Okay, you there with me?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Yeah. Now, in why, you can quickly start with, as you know, that there has been a new amendment to GST. This may have a severe impact on the balance sheets, etcetera. Right. But in a very short statement, maybe not more than two to three statements, set the context. Hence we're having this meeting. Hence, I need to make this presentation. So we are all on the same page on how to use this form or how to comply to the guidelines. Once the context is set, your audience will be more interested in listening to what you want to say. So let me give you a short example here. There was a technical person who I post, and he had to have a call with the organization because there were a lot of issues being experienced with the portal or with the tool which they were using. Now, he had a lot of information about the technical glitches about the bugs and that software, but the audience was not interested with what the bugs are and how many types of bugs. He knows they were interested in the solution. So he started off that. I see we have been experiencing a lot of issues. There are major bugs, minor bugs. And then he went on speaking yappity yappity Yap about the bucks for the next half, which was irrelevant for the audience. It was a 45 minutes call. In the end, only 15 minutes was spent on the solution, which people failed to understand because half the people had lost interest by them.
Speaker B: Okay?
Speaker A: And eventually the call was ineffective. Had he used this tool, you would have known that this is all the information I have. What's relevant for my audience, he would have started with a statement like, I understand we have a lot of issues with this portal and tool. I know there are some major and minor bugs which are impacting the effectiveness of the tool. Today we are going to look at how to resolve these bugs in the most efficient manner. Now, the moment I set stage, people are interested in listening to, okay, he's going to speak about the solution and that is why we are on this part. Then he gave a short intro about the bucks and then he immediately jumped to the solutions and then he left space for questions. So the same call can be made effective, provided there is structure provided to it.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: So once you begin and set the context, then you move in to the body of that communication. Now you highlight points which are very important for the audience, for the listener, for the receiver of the email. Here you need to put a lot of thought that what is important for them, it's not very easy because a lot of times my mind, it deludes me or I believe in assumptions that this is what must be important. No, think again. Why will it be important? Who is this person who I'm speaking to now? I'm sure we never put so much of thought into writing emails or on conference calls. We never, we just go with the flow and we like, okay, fine, it's done. But if you want to be truly effective, then you need to put in all this effort. Now this is, looks like hard work, but it will be hard work for the next one, two months maybe. As you practice this regularly, there'll come a time where your mind will go on autopilot the moment someone tells you, okay, let's discuss this. Your mind will already start structuring the information into beginning, body, end. Who wants this information? What's important for him? Why are we setting this context, etcetera. So then you won't need to put things on paper, but initially you need to, to form the habit, you need to put things on paper. Yeah.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: So in the body you answer the most relevant questions and then finally the ending has to be a conclusion or a summary. Now here, whenever you can structure information into three parts, okay, so remember the rule three. For calls, emails, for presentations, for everyday conversations. If you can summarize your context, if you can summarize the information into three points, it's always easier for the receiver to retain that information. Okay, so which tool are we starting right now?
Speaker B: Bbe.
Speaker A: What does BB stand for?
Speaker B: Beginning body.
Speaker A: And so right now you are reading it. But now if after one I suddenly asked you which tool did we learn today? You will be easily able to retain BBE, beginning, body, end. But instead of that, if there were five steps in this and there were five statements, and I would have asked you to quickly summarize. It's difficult for a person to retain so much information. This is for the rule of three in communication. Now, there will be times when you won't be able to summarize everything in three points. There'll be times when you need the real five points. So I'm not telling you that cut short information, but as far as possible, try and use a rule of three because your audience is able to retain information in a much efficient manner. You summarize with three points. Yes.
Speaker B: Ask me, I can see this working for call for presentations, but emails, wouldn't it make it longer and then repetitive also?
Speaker A: All right, so when I do emails, I start with context setting. Why am I writing this email? So reference our conversation on so and so date. I'm writing to inform you about the changes. Then I write what exact changes I want to communicate. And at the end, in an email, I won't summarize. I'll do a call to action. A call to action is basically that. Now, what do you want me to do? So I've read your email, I've understood what you're trying to say. Now, what next? So do you want me to respond to that email? Do you want me to pass on the information? Or do you just want me to stay informed?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Answers your question.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Awesome. Wonderful. So today we've already done two tools with you. One is the mind map. Second is the BBE tool. So now what I'm going to expect from you is, one, you need to start using this tool. Now, maybe on today's call you may not use this tool, but you will have calls coming up where you can use this tool efficiently. Now, we have a next call planned next week at the same time.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Now, let's say you don't have a call or an email or a conversation or a presentation where you are able to use this tool. By then, I want you to look back on some presentation, some conference call which you led, where you could have effectively used this tool. Use it there and we will review and discuss over our next call whether you feel this tool is effective, whether you feel that had I used this tool in an earlier call, would it have helped me? Or if you get to use it during this week, that would be the best option where you really use the tool and we'll review and, you know, we'll have a good lengthy discussion next week that how has learning this tool helped you remember? This is hard work. Hard work is what people don't like. They detest hard work because we already busy with our everyday life. Deloitte already has given you loads of work. Now this is one added action and this is something you know which people will be like. God, I don't have the time for this. But if you truly want to be effective then there is a lot of work which goes into it. Yes, I do about in conversations a day. Yours is the third conversation going on. There are seven more planned. 07:00. I need to assimilate the data. I get 15 minutes breach between each conversation behind the diary, put in my comments about other reports printing. But I still managed to maybe remove some time to do my reading, to watch a video, to give myself time. Because unless I read upon informational topics, I need to do it for my own device. Yeah, and in your case, once you start using this tool, once we have start having further discussions and how you being able to utilize these tools, then we'll progress into finer aspects of communication. In your case, energy levels. So that's something which is very important. See, you can have all the information, you can be the most knowledgeable person on earth. But if you're unable to present it, if you're unable to be effective, then all the knowledge goes waste. You know, because a lot of times you feel you're smart and someone else that person has grown simply because of their presentation skills. Now, fact of the matter is that no one has the time to do an in depth study into how knowledgeable the individual is. So there your presentation has to make an impact and there is no way that you cannot have energy levels at that point of time.
Speaker B: True.
Speaker A: Great. So I am done with my conversation. Over to you. Any questions for me?
Speaker B: No. I think if I as and when I start working on these tools, maybe I'll come up with more questions.
Speaker A: Sure. So take your time. Think about past experiences where this tool could have helped and we meet next week and have further discussion.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: All right. Have a great day then. Enjoy yourself.
Speaker B: You too.
Speaker A: All right, thanks. Bye bye. 17.
