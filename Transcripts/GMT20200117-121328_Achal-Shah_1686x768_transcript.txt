Speaker A: And also I will give a little of my feedback as well.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Okay. Hi. Today I am going to give the presentation of fire detection and alarm system audio tk. Actually the basic concept what is fire detection system? It actually detects fire. It actually detects fire. Not even fire. When. When it's an initial stage, it detects fire. When it is in the initial stage, it detects through the thru its filled devices which smoke detectors. With the smoke detectors, the fire alarm system detects the fire. What is the need for fire alarm system? Actually a fire alarm system is designed to detect the unwanted presence of fire by monitoring environmental changes associated with combustion. When there is. When, when in the initial stage, when there is fire, the fire, the smoke particles which comes which comes out from the smoke that is captured. Captured by the detectors that is placed above the, on the ceiling. After that, what is automatic fire alarm system and automatic fire alarm system can be used to notify people to evacuate in the event of a fire or other emergency to prepare the structure and association systems to control the spread of fire and smoke. The main function of fire alarm system. Tell me what would be your observations? What do you think? Sir, the main, the first thing that I observed that I was little fast in my presentation, isn't it? I should be little slow. Okay. And that I think that it will help and that that will help me also and the audience also who are listening to the presentation, isn't it? It will help them also. Yes, definitely. Other than that, you said actually a lot of times, right. More than three. More than three times. Right. So try to focus on that. Now. Other few elements in terms of presenting, right. In terms of PowerPoints, if we discuss, let me show so as I shared the TED talk on by David Phillips on how to avoid death by PowerPoint, I don't. You have saved me, sir. You have saved me. You have saved me. Have you been able to go through it, sir? I'm very sorry, sir. Skipped out from it. I'm very sorry, sir. It totally skipped out from my mind, sir, when he said. I remember that. Yes, you have sent me a mail which I skipped. So go through it. Or there's a ligay if everyone has not seen in the workshop. Yeah. I think I might project it again in the workshop. Right. Okay. What's a valid points for example? Right. So yah. Page you have now what we were doing is what you were doing is you were reading from it. Right. Now you, if you're presenting now if I am the audience and I find out. So from the second slide I'm not going to listen to you. 2nd, 3rd slide I'm. This was good. Now you're explaining about each of these detects and how they are different, right. So yahape you have my attention but here I am not going to listen to you. Right. So that is a very small thing. But try actually avoid putting points like this. And if it is sub points you can always spread tab and do it like this. Right. Can be used by used to. Used to notify people to evacuate and to prepare a structure and associate system to control the spread. Okay. And color combination. Maybe s of g is a chai. Hmm. Instead of putting a proper white one you use this. But yeah, it says what I evident slides here. Yeah. You have followed different color tones. Okay. New alak system color, color tone. Use g g sir. All right. Now about the consistency. Make a hair for example. These look consistent, right. These are darker colors and also following the same thing. And this looks abrupt. Color combination is little. Got your point. Color combination with ignapat. If I start with this, take a building. So Iskajo color code follow. So this is good. Bluish gray to gray or gray cathode darker gray to little with a little hint of purple. This is good. So it will change. It is changing. Also we are following the same thing. But in the starting last may add khadi. This is a small, small stir things, right. And always try to add as small as little points as possible. Now what I want to say is for example, let's say yape seek a 13th in point about try to, you know, shorten it, shorten it. Shorten you. I don't want you to read from it. Reading is not an issue, right? Reading is not an issue and as I said, this is what will happen if you want. I got your point. I got your point. Means audience also can read what I have written in it. They are also. They are also educated enough to read the sentence. What I have written is it. Hmm. The whole idea is. The whole idea is that you are the presenter and this is an audio tool. Audio visual tool. You are the presenter. When you're able to create that, your presentation is more effective. If people are looking at your visual tool, then there's no point. Then you would have just mailed the presentation. Right, sir. Got your point. Got your point. Right. And if people say Kara, if you're making it some for someone else. So I think you can even add notes. Take a note. Let's say points maker da. Let's. Okay, let us read this. This effort includes partnering with leading teams industry like 2010, starting a separate division. Hmm. Right. And let's see, so now types here. But these are the things that you will say rather than, rather than writing, isn't it? Hmm. I have a contrast like this within a short span, right. Okay. So keep it in as much as possible. The points made up. You want to make sure that attention is towards us, right? And I think this would be the last call before our workshop. So yes, other than that, how much time do I still have? Ten minutes. Five to ten minutes. What are the things that we want to work on other than this? Right. You know how to form a formal structure, go manage your presentation, Ted talk ledger, make sure to see it. Yes, help a lot because that is why the reason he has named it how to avoid death by PowerPoint. We give so many PowerPoints that, right. And actually there are lots of other ways to do it. Also there are prezi, there are, you know, you can use audio, you can use visuals that has more more effort to it. Sometimes less effort sometimes requires more a better Internet connection. But there are other ways of doing it right. The way you can actually draw and do it. Now industry where we also have to keep it comfortable for our clients, you have to stick, right, right. But when we can, when we want to show innovation, you can definitely try out. Try it out. So other concepts you feel there are things that you need to work on. At least we can have that discussion right now. So my starting was writing mail and all these things. So mail, mail class madam things I can manage her. So voice modulation. Hi. Right. So voice modulation. What we'll do is I will discuss four elements of voice modulation. Because when we are able to bifurcate it, we'll able to identify it and see what we are lacking, right. Then we link vision up, you will be able to see. Okay. And hrdina practice we karpov so in terms of as you said, email writing oga g many cdf for sub that is also seen g g then yeah. Filler words up, reduce karnata as for your pre report, I was reading your pre report initial level kyatha able to express ideas confidently tend to use okay, okay that can be distracting. Linear sequence now you know, understand the sequence. Grammatical errors were not very glaring but that is also good. You stress on words to create emphasis. But if you want to take it forward, we try and understand the four ease of voice modulation. A kapane jubola emphasis is one e of voice modulation. That is word page of stress kirk I am stressing on some words to lay an impact. Please listen to me. Or say, please listen to me. Right. Same words, different meanings. Right. We have enunciation. That is word clarity. Right. Subcivor clarity. Maybe I don't think there is a major issue. Right. Whatever you're pronouncing, whatever you are saying does not have a regional influence to it. Due to which we are lacking in clarity. Right, sir. Now, next to is energy and emotion. Calico. Sorry. The energy make aga, pace, volume. All of these consist of energy. Now, for example, you have to sell something. And you say, I love working with Sterling and Wilson. But if you say it, I love working with Sterling and Wilson. I really love, you know, working with Sterling and Wilson. As well as emotion. We are. The problem with us means working in corporate, we get set in talking in a certain way. Right, sir. Right. Particular Tarika colleagues. Maybe there might be little change with our seniors and our clients. But overall it is the same. And the only time emotions really show either you're very happy or very angry. Very angry, yes. So when I'm very angry or very. So you. So bringing out emotions will really help when you want to put something across. Sometimes don't be say we felt. We felt it. Yes. It's about how they show emotions to it. Right. So. And that is very important. Let me just connect my charger. All right. Yeah. So if we see an example, right. The example may just. Hold on, let me open that. Right. We just watched this for two minutes. Two to five minutes. So if you. Do you know Sylvester Stallone? No, sir. Okay. Sylvester Stallone is an english actor. Wait. Rocky Balboa movie hair. John Rambo hair movie hair. So Skype particular Mujabatikana. I'll just tell you about the actor first. So this is the actor, american actor, director, screenwriter movies. John Rambo and all. You're very famous. It is in the english world. Rocky, especially Rocky is a very famous movie. What I want to say is, if you see I got a face, you will understand that he has paralysis on one side, right? Left side, but over paralysis, right? Which when you. Even when he's speaking. Now, I want you to show this clip and understand the range of emotions and energy. Kajo modulation. This is from Brahi Balboa, right? Just watch it. In terms of voice modulation, this is a son, okay? The references is going now he's retired as a boxer in the movie, right? And is still taking up a fight, kissing challenge. And he's like, I'm going. And his son is pissed off and they're having this conversation on the street, living with you, it hasn't been easy. People see me, but they think of you. Now, with all this going on, this is gonna be worse than ever.
Speaker B: It don't have to be.
Speaker A: No, sure it does.
Speaker B: Why? You got a lot going on, kid.
Speaker A: Well, my last name, that's the reason I got a decent job. That's the reason why people deal with me in the first place. Now, I start to get a little ahead. I start to get a little something for myself, and this happens. Now, I'm asking you as a favor not to go through with this, okay? This is only gonna end up bad for you, and it's gonna end up bad for me.
Speaker B: You think I'm hurt, Iska?
Speaker A: Word. Stress indeed. When you're actually angry, you stress a little more, right? Right. It's gonna end up bad for you and bad for me. Like irritation, man. Nikola. Yeah, in a way, you are.
Speaker B: It's the last thing I ever wanted to do.
Speaker A: I know that's not what you want to do, but that's just the way that it is. Don't you care what people think? Doesn't it bother you that. That people are making you out to be a joke, and then I'm gonna be included in that? Do you think that's right? Do you?
Speaker B: You ain't gonna believe this, but you used to fit right here. I'd hold you up and say to your mother, this kid's gonna be the best kid in the world. This kid's gonna be somebody better than anybody I ever knew. And you grew up good and wonderful. It was great just watching. Every day was like a privilege. Then the time come for you to be your own man and take on the world, and you did. But somewhere along the line, you changed. You stopped being you. You let people stick a finger in your face and tell you you're no good. And when things got hard, you started looking for something to blame, like a big shadow. Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place. And I don't care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is going to hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done. Now, if you know what you're worth now, go out and get what you're worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you want to be because of him or her or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain't you. You're better than that. I'm always gonna love you, no matter what. No matter what happens. You're my son and you might blame.
Speaker A: Right. Were you able to see the range of emotions? Yes. Even switching from high energy to losing pausing and seeing his expression, he's checking the audience. Right. There also means checking the audience, how they are receiving the energy and then lowering it. Right, sir. Right. So this is just one example. And you also saw with the paralysis, he's actually making more efforts to speak. Yes, yes. But lug nira, because. Just because I told you, you were able to notice that. Right, sir. Right. But if someone is listening for the first time, you wouldn't get it. Casa. Yes. Ah, right, right. Siev. Right. A few practices that we can do is that same way, record your voice and try to inculcate more emotions. Especially now. You are someone who goes to clients. If you are not excited about the work that you do, how are they going to keep you? Right, right. They're going to see the technical. Technical that they can get. You have to be strong in that. But showing that you're really excited about it makes all the difference over excitement. Right, right. Though. But yes, excitement and all that. Emotions do make a difference. A lot of difference. Right, right, right. Your body language, it all makes the difference. I will send one more video by David Phillips. Communication. Watch that as well. Okay. And practice, practice. Keep. When you're conversing, just be more aware of the four ease you're doing. Emphasis. And you have good enunciation, emotional energy, and for fluency, taking a deep breath and watching your pace will help. One more thing that you can do is let me open that. So there is a app which uses artificial intelligence to do the work for you, whatever you are speaking. All right, all right. Kirk, the speech app. Okay. Right. If you put that, it's on the Play store. Yes. Google Play store mileage. So it's not a complete. Can you just. Can you. I cannot see what. Hello. Started downloading that. Orai, a one communications coach. Yes. With the bread parrot. Right. So that will help you. It's not a completely free app. I think the first month or the first ten minutes is free. Okay. After that, it's searchable. Okay. Yes. But if you really find it useful, it's an amazing app. Okay. For example, let me refresh. I think my router got reset. Yeah. For example, you spoke for 40, 50 seconds. And we'll give you a report like this. Average words per minute, pausing, score, energy, score clarity, and even if you're using filler words. So it is an amazing app. Now, for example, you wanted to control pace. Now, what happens is, when you're trying to lower your pace, you lower it too much initially, you want to keep it in between. So it even has a pace meter like this job. Boulder Sativo. Up, down, up, down, over. So it's an amazing app to practice when you don't really have a coach for your. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So now this. And it's like 500 per month. If you even. Okay. If you take it for one or two months, you see a lot of difference in your speech. Okay? Okay. All right. This will practice correct before the workshop, I think. Workshop difference. Right, sir. Right. Even if you spend 1015 minutes every day, you see a lot of difference. Okay. Okay. All right. Okay, sir. Okay. Thank you, sir. See you in the workshop, then. Okay. Thank you. Okay, bye.
