Speaker B: This purposely, when I tried it, I saw that they couldn't question you more, give an explanation. They can make more questions out of it. So it's like, okay, whatever he's saying, it's final, it's correct. So it has an impact now to use it. Why? By means we have to practice that. We don't have to blink too much. Then the head has to be straight. Whatever I saw in the video, it's extremely good. I think I'll practice this. And in the meetings I'll practice this.
Speaker A: Before you set some rules for practicing this, I'd like to mention like two major aspects which was also discussed during the workshop.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: The, actually three. Okay. So it's like a triangle. Relationship always gets derived from the trust and credibility aspect. So do you remember that flow chart? I shared with you.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: I showed you this video so that you improve on your personality in your own personal life more. First grocery shopping tomorrow, you want to start your own business. Working for any big MNC, doesn't matter. Comes first. And that is why our discussion has more been around nonverbal communication because it consists of more than 70% of the information. You as a person. But if I have to talk about trust and credibility, in this sense, whatever tips she shared actually requires two things. One is the culture of the organization and second is, uh, the people mindset. Okay. So you'll have to be very calculative about how do you use it. That is something which I leave up to you. I for it, because I do not yet know the working culture of CEAT. These are the four or five tips. Whatever she shared. I think you should start Google than a hit and trial method. I want you to start doing that more and it's more relate. So do you remember we saw the power poses in the videos, the video with Amika D. Right. I want you to collaborate it with your eye contact here.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: Because I think your body language is going to be super awesome. Going ahead. You're already focusing on that. And the most important thing for me, Sunil, is that, see, I am a facilitator here. So for me it's more about you paving your own path. And you're doing that right now. Work is to provide you with resources. So I have complete trust on you that you are going to nail the non verbal communication aspect. So that is why I showed you the eye contact specifically. This was the specific video for you. Now, going ahead, there will be different levels to it as well. But what do I want you to do is practice this for the next at least two weeks, combine it with the body language, and tell me, how did it go? What didn't work? How did you see changes in people reacting to you after a certain body language? And don't worry about hierarchy with anyone. That is something which I'll be very frank about. I know that there are people around you, like, do not respect other people, to be frank, or their work, at least. So you can actually use these fire poses more on them, gain more trust and credibility, so that your word becomes final, because now you're stronger on a client end. You have to create a culture within your office. You have to create a culture within your team and your people who are working with you. So that would be my first suggestion.
Speaker B: Okay.

Speaker A: I would like to really combine it with the linguistic styles. So did you get a chance to watch the Steven Pinkers video?
Speaker B: Yes, I watched Steven Pinker at a stretch for the first time. But I have to go through it again because I could capture lot of things, but not completely because the video is quite big for me.
Speaker A: Obviously. that is why, see, generally, I do not give such big videos to people, but because you are a person who is learning, who is on that path. And I've seen. I've seen that. What do I say? That fire in you, that drive in you. And that is why I think if you are actually able to understand that, you will be able to actually pull things in your direction more. That was my whole purpose of giving you that. So let me take it very simple today and discuss, like, four major reasons of why I wanted to acquainted with the linguistic styles. You are good with observations. The moment a person is good with observations, especially in the non verbal aspect, if he or she combines it with the verbal aspect, understand the person better. And that is how you tweak the communication. Right. Because ultimately, all of us are trying to persuade each other. Right. Like, to merek hateriye Karlo. Okay. We have logics, facts, figures, everything. But people are working with you for you and not for the product. Exactly. So if you actually understand the linguistic aspect, the rest of the 30% aspect of its me, you are with the rest of the audience. There is no deal that you cannot crack after that. So strategy building in all is your area. That is not my area. To improve your learnability in different fields. That's chicken. Okay, so minimum.

Speaker A: Yeah. Can you share the screen, right now? I think it into different aspects for you.
Speaker B: Okay. So it was like the learning for me. I was able to capture and recall. The first thing is like writing is not something which you are born with. You can speak. If you go for the biggest theory by Darwin, he says it's a natural instinct that you can speak, but it's natural instinct that you can write. So it's a craftsman work. So you have to understand how to write, what to write. And there is a classic style that classic style does include means first you have to understand whatever you are writing. So if you are writing to somebody, do you imagine that person, he not come and intervene what you are writing? I can't understand this. I can understand that why you are written this. So you have to first understand from the perspective of that person also that whom you are writing for. So classic style, which is the basic style, which is the first style, which he tried to explain it to. It tells you to means it's mostly not about the interior of the things. It's about the concern means what you want to show him. It's not about the other detailing and all. If you have mountain, you just want to show him the mountain. You don't want to run around that. I went through this road, I reached there, there was a top then and went there. And finally I found that there was a mountain. You want to showcase that what you want to tell him what you saw and you want him to see the same. So that is the classic style. Then in between I found there were a number of interesting things. Like he said, don't use numbers with people. It's a mistake. Like we say, five people came here. So he said people came here, four people went away. How many people are left? One people, which is wrong. So we don't have to use number with people. And there were things like passives, which we use a lot. And I realized that I also use a lot like to showcase that we know extraordinary. We speak totally different. We are like the creators of the application and all. So it is all stupid. He tried to explain that whatever passive writing is given there in simple words how easy it is to understand. And sometimes it can be life saving, like he said, the example of that, I think some gas chambers being used by the Americans inside because there was a warning that co plus extensive temperature is going to get you into a trouble, but nobody noticed it. When using the chambers inside your home can kill you instantly. It was a clear cut message, so it was even. The best part was that he highlighted the things, the kind of the mistakes or the kind of the wrong usage with respect to people like George Bush, Barack Obama. It means that mistakes can happen at each and every level by every individual. But it's to understand that how you can correct it so pass you is something which he told, which I started accepting and understanding this. Yes, we use a lot of sew words, which is wrong. We have to be straight, we have to be simple. Then the other part that I shared with you. So I have to run through it again to get more into it. But there were seven to eight aspects which were really good.

Speaker A: Let me add a few aspects here. Since you're watching the video, I want you to watch it in these three contexts. So linguistic styles are basically hum in the form of social linguistics. Okay. Ultimately, it's about people interaction for us, right? Social sociolinguistics, which affects the whole linguistic style, the pattern. That is why japanese people speak a certain way. And why are we going to japanese? Think about the british people and the american people, their English and the way they pronounce words and the way they speak, the way they address is completely different. What is the reason? The reason is maybe the background, the bringing up story, the people, the history, community. So many aspects go around it. But there are three major things which never go out of fashion. Sociolinguistics. Okay, the one is the style. So you, right now, you are talking about some of the styles in which people speak. The second is the tone. You'll find some people to be very loud. You'll. You'll find some people to be very fast, be very slow. So, tone has got everything to do with face first, pace, hotel or pitch hotel. So now our indian. Indian people are very expressive, right? Imagine large population, all of us are talking above each other. And that is how our voice raises. At the same time, we are very expressive with our hands, isn't it? But if you go to place like Britain, or if you go to place like us, you not find. People will think that we are crazy because we are being too expressive. And people don't get hyper how people react over that to us. But this is our culture, right? This is how our community is brought up. So we have two aspects, space and pitch. Now, third aspect, which even I am trying to explore, and it's a part of my research going ahead, is the register. So what does register means register refers to the particular type of language used for particular cases. Okay, so how do I explain this to you? So let's say it basically comes from the aspect of emotions. Okay, so let's say a person is. And if someone calls you up, you'll be like, call you later. Because I am really in a rush and I'm about to catch my plane, I'm stuck in traffic. So tone or style complement kirk result. That is what register means. Okay, so your style plus tone equals to register. So that three major elements that actually enhance the linguistic style of any particular individual.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: This guy is really assertive. You know, assertive and at the same time you like, this guy is really aggressive. I just don't want to see his face. There's so many aspects to. So whatever we are describing people as, they are actually registers of people find that no register is very similar. People may be similar, but people are not the same. Okay, so maybe today I'll keep, keep it to these three aspects and I want you to go ahead with the video once again. Okay, then I want you to come up with five cases for the style plus tone equals to register. I want you to pick up like five people from your surrounding style. Observe Kara from the Steven Pinker's video. See, could be either one aspect or multiple aspects of style. Dominant style. But Uska regular style will be a combination of those styles. So you start out key what all you can do one for yourself as well. So that way what will happen is you will be able to register that. How do I study people such that my communication with them becomes better? Because then the second step will be how do you communicate with a person a. How do you communicate with person b. Your communication style and enhance it. Because you want to become an all rounder when it comes to convincing others and getting your work done. Because ultimately that is why we are communicating with people. Right? So Apna strategy, convince Karnakili Samnawaleka, phone and register. Go assess Karna Parega. Do you think you can do that, Sunil?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: I don't mind doing that. But do you think one day is enough to register this? Like to analyze the style, tone and register, because you will need at least three to five samples with that person, right? Your information is not very efficient.
Speaker B: Yes, it's quite possible because I had been observing people earlier also. But yeah, when I have gone through all this training and all now register them as per what is being given them. Like I have a usual perception about the people that I'll shortlist and I'll go for the limited interaction or the unlimited interaction we have, but now I have to filter it as per the linguistic video, as per the. Those two, three verticals which you said, the pitch, the body language, style and all.

Speaker A: Okay, so do we have a triangle here? We do not have a triangle here. Okay, let me make it easier for you. There's something called a style. Already exploring right now is something called as two combined, give you the whole register of the person. Okay, now, if you have to talk about linguistic styles, you are already exploring that. So I don't want to dig into it right now because you are yet to come up. You want to go through that once again, and I want you to go through it once again. Whereas when it comes to tone, right now, there are several aspects in tone, pronunciation, clarity, blah, blah, blah. Everything comes over there. Right now I want focus on these two aspects. And. Yes. So, abhi, what do I want you to do? I want you to create a register of at least five individuals who may say one is you, basically every day. And the second thing is that you have to pick up four people, out of which people with whom you are working very closely, that will be audience. And there are two people with whom you work on a basis or like twice a week conversation. Basically, I would expect a person, one person over here. And I want you to tell me your understanding about their style and tone, and hence create a register. Now, before you start doing this today, I want you to go and explore a bit of linguistics. Like, you will find it in a. I don't want you to go ahead and read it about. Read about it for like three. Go to YouTube type social linguistics. See what are the factors affecting. What factors can be taken into consideration, if any other factors for experimenting with the register? Right. I just gave you like a very simple base. There is a scope of exploration here. Can we expand it? Sunil, at the end of the day, and this is how I communicate with that person, the nonverbal. So if you want, you can add the non verbal. So as well over here. Do you think you can do that? Too much of a task.
Speaker B: Not too much. Because I have to go through that video again because I have to. Because my broader understanding of that video was that how we communicate in written means. Written communication. Now, this has something to do with the style page, stitch, everything. I have to go through it, understand what kind of a communication they are using, what is. What is their pitch, what is their style? And then I have to register them and understand what kind of a person is like. A person. He is a person with a dominating style, a higher pitch, a higher pace. And how do I tackle that guy?
Speaker B: Own communication. What should I use?
Speaker A: So basically, Sunil, it's a one time hard work. That is something which I am committing to. The reason being they speaking. You ask your other participants, who are my learners, have been into normal communication aspects. You are the one who is taking it to a leadership level, Frank. And that is why this task is a bit difficult because I am giving you this task because I know you are going to do this. That is something which I am very clear about. So I know this is a one time hard work. Once this is registered in your brain, you will be able to utilize it to your advantage every now and then because this thing never gets old and people do not go into such depth when they are talking. So I want you to explore it this week and meet again in our next call. And I want to see what you have created out of it.

Speaker B: I need one more help. I need to, for example, give an example. For example, I am registering a person, somebody whose style is like a dominating character. Okay. A high, high pace, a high page. And I will also have a register for myself. The way I behave usually.
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: How do I tone it with respect to that person who is having a dominating style, a high base.
Speaker A: That is where the whole. So let's say that depends on what are your points, which mix and match with him. So see, until, unless I don't have a sample, I can't tell it to you right there and then I want to see it on an excel sheet.
Speaker B: Okay. It's fine. So I will come up with say five people, including me. Style Facebook will register them. I will also social logistics to understand more clearly on this. Then I'll put everybody into a different quadrant then. What should be the reaction or how we have to communicate? Exactly. But I believe that if we talk about overall the non verbals that we have been talking about, even the eye contact, I. Whatever we have seen or whatever we have practiced, we can use with each and every individual. Because I understand. I'm just saying that for example, if there are some four to five observations which I have seen in the eye contact, I can use that eye contact formula with a low pitch, a high pitch, a slow pace, a high pace, a dominating style, non dominating. With any kind of a character.
Speaker A: It's not specific exactly, but sorry, but.
Speaker B: Now I have to see, like these individuals which we will be registering. Do we set up something different or do we need to twist and tone our existing tools which we have to match the communication or to do what kind of a business we want to do?
Speaker A: Okay, you are thinking way too much before getting into the.
Speaker B: Because I also want to understand. I just want to understand a simple thing. For example, somebody is having a dominating style, high pitch. I may portray myself again a dominating character, but not maybe with a high pitch. Now what to be done? Do I need to have an equal pitch? No, I don't think I need to be an equal pitch. I believe I need to have a sense. When I talk, it has to have sense.

Speaker A: So you are giving this here? Exactly. What I was going to say is you need to start playing with your words.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: It's about adaptability, isn't it? Eye contact is something used with anyone. But if you actually see in real life and a person very intimidating because of his high pitch and his open body language, you will not mirror that person. There are very few cases mirror that person. If you are intimidated, become opposite of that person. I am asking you to buckle up to start thinking that, okay, this guy is intimidating. I don't care. I am going to intimidating as that person because kabikawa. Okay, are you getting my point?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Until and unless you don't register a person. You are focusing on aspects like eye contact, body language. You are the non verbals. The moment I asked you to start understanding their linguistic styles, who will know how to tweak them with your own linguistic style? Because ultimately, what are you trying to do? You are trying to tweak your conversation in every field. Let's say we use passives now, but at the same time, there are some people who look very complicated, but they expect a very simple solution. So do we understand is bande Koham simplicity. See it as Kisamnavala complicated at complicated? Bhatkar.
Speaker B: Okay, so my question was other way around. Like, I register everybody semi complicated, a super complicated. But can I practice something which can be relevant to all the people need to register something that hearthike asa have but mandate may not require to change everything which I am practicing. If I am practicing only the best so it can be means we can implement it on the people. Just to register everybody on my mind so that I don't go wrong. I think all these parameters will drive me close and close to all these practices like nonverbals, eye contact, linguistic style. Be specific. To be specific like that.
Speaker A: Yes. That is all I want to do because that's what I said. There are certain universal aspects which you already hold and which you are going to learn. There are certain things which are universal. Joki, sabkili, apply, hoga change, karniki, zaratni. But just non verbal realization here. Linguistics kabhi realization. So that your communication.
Speaker B: Okay, now I got it completely. I got it completely.
Speaker A: Cool. Then I have another call starting. I'm already ten minutes late. I will see you in the next call. Sunil.

Speaker B: I need car. You read that?
Speaker A: Yeah, I need car. Manevode, but I forgot to ask you about it. Sorry.
Speaker B: It was. It was after a detailed analysis when you said me, you start writing. So as of now, what I understood the most of the time that is getting wasted because I have been transferred to a location and right now I have taken a property which is close to these assemblers and all. And here I need to have an individual vehicle. Exactly. To save my time to stop wastage of everything. So that's what I had given you, a conclusion. Instead of writing all the aspects, that is the conclusion. So I said.
Speaker A: Basically you gave me a commitment. Good, good solo. I've come up with the solution. I want to, like. I not want to see the times sheet, but I want to discuss a bit of it. Sunil, in the next call, though, there are different aspects and that discussion is getting. I need more time to discuss things.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: I can't do calls in half an hour with you, especially because you are working on. On things and I really want to see if I can help you in some more enhanced manner. Tika Tika. I'll see you in the next call then.
Speaker B: Okay, thank you. Bye.
