Speaker A: Hello? Aishwarya, can you please check if you have muted your device because I'm not able to hear you. Yeah.
Speaker B: Hello?
Speaker A: I think it was not plugged in. Okay. Hi. How are you?
Speaker B: Hi. I'm good. How are you?
Speaker A: Okay. I'm good, too. You're always before time. That's one thing I've noticed. You're a very powerful person. Are you? Am I right?
Speaker B: Yes. Yes, I am.
Speaker A: So I got it. Okay, then. So, for today, Aishwarya, we're going to discuss about narratives. Okay. So I actually was thinking about it that, you know, how should we drive the idea of narratives for you? Okay. So, initially, I thought that maybe I can ask you about a work life situation. You explain it to me, then I understand it. Then we'll work around narratives. But then I also realized if I use this approach, I will be stealing the joy of narratives from you, which felt extremely unfair to do. So how we are going to go about it is that, first of all, we will spend our time, spend, like, maybe one or two sessions understanding what narratives are. Okay. Without any context of. Or rather a filter of work or, you know, the purpose of it or why I want to learn it. Let's understand narratives first. Okay. And then we will. Once we understand what narrative is, what it is made up of, why is it there? Why is it important in the first place? Then we will graduate towards understanding your situation and then fit in the pieces there. Does that sound good to you? Does that sound fair? Yes.
Speaker B: Yes. Yes.
Speaker A: Okay. Okay. So you tell me, uh, what. What do you understand by narratives?
Speaker B: Narratives? Uh, maybe, you know, a paragraph or something describing something.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: You are narrating a story. You're narrating a situation. You are narrating a scenario. That is something I understand from the word narratives.
Speaker A: Okay. Okay. So, as you just mentioned, there are some. There is an event. Just. Just give me a go ahead.
Speaker B: Yes, Kanti. Oh, for now. Okay, can you give me just. Yes, I want to figure out some other meeting room.
Speaker A: Go ahead. Sure. It. Yes, you're done?
Speaker B: I'm done. But I didn't get a meeting room. Okay. I just figured out something, and I cannot block this room.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: I hope nobody turns up here for next one.
Speaker A: Okay. So I prefer to block a slot for 1 hour because sometimes it happens that the discussions do get. You know, they overflow. So. But I think for today, we can make it quick. Okay, so you. You were telling me about how any story is a form of narrative, right?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: So you broadly captured what a narrative is. It is you know, it is a story. It's a collection of events that are connected to each other. So have you. There are many movies, right, where there are ten different stories in one. Let's say, I. Not able to think of an example because I'm not much of a movie buff, but let's say, have you seen Dashant? Have you seen Das Kahanya?
Speaker B: I have not seen it.
Speaker A: But the movie in itself is a compilation of ten stories. And these ten stories are completely isolated from one another. So these ten stories actually become ten narratives and not one single narrative. Okay, and how is that?
Speaker B: As you rightly said, because they are not connected.
Speaker A: Exactly. So a narrative essentially captures events, okay. From beginning to end. The events, you know, one thing leads to the other or there is some sort of relationship that is there. There are a lot of movies that have been made that while you're watching them, it'll look like they are two separate stories. Okay? But then in the end, the writer will manage to bring in that connect and you will realize, okay, the characters were linked. So, you know, that's. That's the beauty of narratives that you can actually play around with the way your audience is going to perceive the story. Okay? Okay. So, um. So if I have to ask you. So now we understand, broadly understand, something.
Speaker B: Is wrong with the signal. Hello.
Speaker A: Yeah, actually, I think your screen was frozen.
Speaker B: And I felt the same at your side.
Speaker A: Okay, cool. So it's actually showing that your network is fluctuating a little. That's okay. I said, yeah, yeah, that's okay. Okay. So I was asking that now that we broadly understand what a narrative is. Okay. What do you think is a narrative made up of? What all does it have any story. What. What is it that the story has as ingredients in it?
Speaker B: Characters.
Speaker A: Perfect.
Speaker B: If it's a story, there is a dialogue for those characters.
Speaker A: Correct. Okay. That.
Speaker B: That can. That can drive the entire story.
Speaker A: Perfect. Yes.
Speaker B: There is a connection between those characters.
Speaker A: Mm hmm.
Speaker B: So the dialogs also captures your language portion.
Speaker A: Okay. Okay.
Speaker B: So that there is certain language which. Which connects.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: To the entire characters. And everything leads to a conclusion.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: At the end. Yeah.
Speaker A: Right. So you very rightly mentioned that characters is a very. They are a very important part of any narrative, or else it. It becomes a textbook. Right. So if I'm just telling you the statistics about beer bear attacks in some part of Maharashtra, or tiger attacks, whatever the statistics, is not a story because there are no characters in it. But if I tell the same story to a child. If you have. Have you read the story of three little pigs.
Speaker B: No, I don't think so.
Speaker A: Never mind. So basically, both of the story, the three little pigs, and a statistic statistical report about, let's say, the population of pigs or whatever. Let's imagine for a while both of them are talking about the same animal, right? But the fact that the animals do not have a motive. The fact that the animals do not. You know, the events do not lead to anything. Eventually, that is essentially what makes one a narrative. And another informative piece. Okay, so you very rightly mentioned that characters are very important. Now, of course we have a main character, okay? Now, the main character usually is portrayed as a positive. Or rather, you know, the protagonist. Basically, the protagonist normally is portrayed as somebody who's. Who has all the good motives, all the good intentions. And the antagonist becomes the person who's against this person. But when we look at a narrative, any individual who played any part in that story as a result of the events affecting them. So, you know, usually we like to think that people make stories, but when we look at literature, the events make people. Are you getting it?
Speaker B: Yes. Yes.
Speaker A: So, I mean, any. Any other day, it's very convenient for us to say this. The narratives are about the people. Correct? But actually, the narratives are about the events and how those events affect these people. So any person in a story who is affected by an event, that person becomes a character. No matter in what way, to what extent, to what degree. As long as a person has been affected by those events, the person becomes a character in the story. Because there is some sort of change in the character's life because of those events. Now, I am repetitively using the word events, okay? Which is essentially the soul of any narrative, right? I mean, imagine if I film my life for 365 days, from morning to evening, with nothing happening. A routine. I am following the same routine every day. Would that ever become a story somebody would want to listen to?
Speaker B: Definitely not.
Speaker A: Definitely not. And if somebody likes that story, I think that's a person we might judge. But then. So there are these events, you know, of all sorts. These events could be related to the person themselves, okay? A moment of realization or, you know, a failure that they experience in life. The event could be completely external, a natural calamity, okay? Or let's say, a financial breakdown in the house. The event can be anywhere. It could be something that, you know, that roots into the character or that roots into the environment. Environment of the character. But an event basically affects this person. Right? So let's see movies. So it's very difficult for me to find which movies? For both of us. Okay, so now that both of us have watched Dangal, we know who the characters are.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Okay. So let's. Let's begin in a very systematic flow. Okay? So if I have to ask you, you've watched Dangal, and I'm asking for your opinion about that movie. Okay? Okay. And then I ask you that, Aishwarya, what is this movie about? So what would you tell me in general?
Speaker B: So this movie is about. About a father who is. Who is a western. And he. He was aspiring for the gold medal for India. And this is the way he. He fights against the society and he trains his girl child became a wrestler.
Speaker A: Correct. So this is how you have summarized the story for me. Right. I could also say that the story is about. The story is about this father, as you said, was an aspiring wrestler and has certain struggles in his life. Correct. So you have essentially captured the whole crux of the story. You captured the character. So let's say for you, the story is about a father. For me, it could be a story about two girls.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Right. So the character, maybe because you look at the events differently than I do. Right? So there is. There is a father, the character, the other characters, the mother, the, you know, or the whole village that come around to advise the father to have a son. If you remember, that was a common part in the movie. And the daughters and everything, all of these people are the characters. But there is always a theme. Uh, you know, in a narrative, you will always find that there is a theme. Now, when you mention the summary of the story, you actually focus on those little events that happen. Okay, so these events that we're referring to, they are called plot points. Okay. Okay. Sr. Samjo Kia book per day chapters. So each chapter, because there is something that you learned in one chapter, there is something that, you know, links it to the next and to the next and to the next. But they are different from one another. Right. So that is what a plot would be. You know, these events. One thing happens here which leads to a subsequent event, then it leads to a subsequent event, and then eventually we have a closure. Hopefully not always. Okay. Because. So these are the plots, but even these events, they're always linked to each other in a way that they always talk about one common thing. Okay, I think I've made it complicated. Have I?
Speaker B: No.
Speaker A: Okay, got it?
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Okay. Okay. So let's say if we go back to the example of the book, even though it has these different chapters, with each chapter educating you about something. There is always. The book at large talks about something. It's a self help book. Okay. In one chapter, a self help book may talk about. Let's say, may talk about the writer's experience, about how they change something for themselves. Then later, it may talk about, you know, one issue to the other end. But each of these is going to be linked to the main core. Right. But all of it, it's. Again, in the same book. It talks about the same thing.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Now, if I have to simplify it, it will be. What do you think it is about? The movie is about struggle. The movie is about patriotism. The movie is about. It's a satire. So satire is a, uh, work where, you know, you. You present the ugly reality in a very comic manner. The satire is also. So PK was actually a satire, if you like.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Okay. Yes. So this way, this becomes the theme of the movie. Okay. Of course, there is genre. There are. There are movies that are, you know, rom coms, there are comedy, there are action movies, whatever. But if you narrow it down, you'll come down to themes. Now, what does the movie talk about? Then it comes down to the plots. What are the events in the moon? I should not use the word movie because it's essentially. It could be a written thing also. So what is. What are the events in the story? You know, what is the story revolving around? Revolving around. Correct. There is something called as the setting of that place, which is very important. Now, imagine if I make a story about gender equality. Okay. In a country like Finland. Okay, so Finland is one of the. It's actually a telling example in matters like gender equality in a country like that. If I base my story on gender equality in a country like that, will it make sense to the reader or the viewer of that content? Maybe.
Speaker B: No.
Speaker A: Yeah, but it may. But most likely, the general consensus will be that. Correct. But if I make the same story in a country like ours. Okay. Or in a country like, you know, the Gulf countries of Saudi Arabia, there it might actually be a revolutionary work. And why is this happening? Because the setting is different. Correct. So the setting is very important if it's a village. So, Dangal, the fact that it was a small village in Haryana where women wrestling men was an audacious idea. This very fact in itself, the setting of the story gives it so much life. If it was a story about two girls living in Mumbai, you know, from a well off family, get a professional training for wrestling, and then make it to the Commonwealth Games, then maybe the struggle itself will be diluted there.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Do you realize the importance of setting in something?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: How? The same story, the same characters, the same events. You change the setting, the whole context, the whole intensity of the story can change. Correct. Now, these settings are also linked to something that we call as conflicts. Because when this father, who never got professionally trained, was living in Haryana, the conflict was that these are two girls. Remember that dialogue? What is this? This is a conflict. A conflict could be anything, Aishwarya. And let's. Let's look at ourselves. Even our life is like a story, right? We are all people in making. We are all stories in making, actually. But we are all stories in making. Right? So we also have these conflicts in life.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: All types of conflicts. Sometimes we have conflicts about with other people. So it's a human versus human conflict. Okay. So sometimes, you know, you had a friend, a very good friend. And now you do not talk because of some misunderstanding. That's a human versus human conflict. There could be something like a human versus nature conflict. Human versus society conflict. And the most intricate type is, I think, the human versus one self conflict. Correct. And you think that you yourself are the conflict in the story that you're in. Right. So these conflicts are essentially what give life to your characters. Correct. Now, depending upon the nature of the conflict, it can come from the external environment. It can be rooted in the person. Also, if it's a person versus person conflict, you know, I have conflicting thoughts or I have done something that is against my morals, my principles, whatever. And then I go on a journey to fix it. The journey of realization. So that conflict is very different from a conflict like the one shown in the movie Lagan. But it is completely external. Right. So these conflicts, even though the word itself is very negative. That is what makes the end beautiful, doesn't it?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Because it is all about resolution of. Correct. So think back to any event in your life, okay? Any event in your life when you think you have experienced such conflict. So let's say if your marriage is a love marriage and if you had some difficulty convincing your parents or if you know of a friend or a sibling, whoever, that could be a conflict. But the fact that the person actually ended up being with the one they wanted, the resolution of it. Isn't that what gives beauty to their whole story? Correct.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: So. Or something like. I mean, I remember having a friend. So she came from a very small village. Okay? So in her village, not a single girl had studied beyond 9th standard. And by the time they would, they should be in their 10th grade. They will get married. And even before they reach the age of 17, most of them would have a kid. Now from such a place. I had this classmate of mine whose father went against the whole village. The whole village altogether got her educated. She completed her graduation. She completed her masters. She started working. And then in today's time, she's still working. She's married. And things have worked out perfectly well for her. Besides, she has also earned tremendous respect for herself and for her father. Correct. So imagine if this was yet another story. This is one girl from that village I picked the same village, the same situation and another girl who was very ambitious about education. But then she gave in to her the society's pressure. Which of the two stories is going to be more. I don't want to use the word inspiring because a story could affect you in many ways. But which of these two stories do you think is going to evoke more intense emotions?
Speaker B: The first one.
Speaker A: Correct. And why did it happen, Ashwarya?
Speaker B: Because as you rightly said, there is some conflict and that has been resolved. And the outcome is. Is the happy endings.
Speaker A: Correct. Or sometimes the outcome is not even a happy ending. I mean, in life, most of the times. I mean, movies are movies. Of course. We watch movies because it lets us escape our life. Right. Or people read books because many a times, fiction specially, it allows you to escape your own reality. Right. So even if the ending is not essentially a happy ending, it still led to something. Right. It evokes a certain emotion in you and that is what matters. Correct. So there are some. Especially if you're inclined towards art. Art films. You will realize that most of them do not really have a happy ending. But they leave you with so much food for thought.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Right?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: So whatever we have discussed till now, if I have to summarize it in 90 seconds, I would say that actually. Let's do it. You do it. Let's summarize. Yes. I am doing all the talking. Let's summarize what we discussed about a narrative in 90 seconds for me.
Speaker B: So, narrative is not just a part of information but it's a sort of story having characters into it which are linked to each other, interlinked to each other. There. They suppose there should be a conflict to bring in a life to that entire narrative in it. Because the resolution of the conflict will get you to the conclusion part which will complete your narrative.
Speaker A: Correct. So you covered it all. Right. And around this are the external but very essential things like setting, like floor. So that becomes very important here we discussed about the theme that. What do you think it is about? The patriotism kibarim movie. This opinion itself. So this is where we are showing a preference or a dislike for a certain theme, right? Yes. That is how it essentially works. Okay. Then we have point of views. So have you watched Dil Dharakne, though?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Correct. Point of view. Kiska hairs moving there. So this literally is my point of view. Point of view becomes observed physically. Thought process, case event. Or a teenager. Disturbing. So in that story, are you able to recall?
Speaker B: I'm not clear about this.
Speaker A: Okay. Okay. I'll frame myself. My question better. So story. Is that story up? That story begins with the dog introducing the members of the family.
Speaker B: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Speaker A: So imagine they have managed to bring in the point of view of a dog also. Oh, okay. And then the camera zooms out and here is the pet. The point of view also becomes very important. If an alien actually landed on our planet and tried to make sense out of it, actually in our country, to be precise, and then tried to make sense out of this is completely the aliens point of view. Correct. That is from his point of view that we are viewing it, that also matters. Let's look at ourselves again. We are all, you know, stories eventually. So CAC related. Anything, anything ticket. I was so silly five years ago. So imagine the power of point of view here. It can give a lot of strength to your story. It might sound like a theory right now, but remember the importance of each of these elements in a narrative. That's what our goal is.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: So remember what each element in a story can do. I'll give you an example. In your work, if you're presenting a particular analysis that you have done or a particular report that you have made, you said that if I only talk numbers, people don't get it and then they come back to you with all sorts of questions. So if your numbers were the characters in the story and the calculation behind these numbers analysis run here. Statistics. If they were the events in the story. So will it not give more life to it?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: So have you used spss? The software called spss?
Speaker B: No.
Speaker A: Okay. Okay. That is the only statistics I know.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker A: I. I think I broke up with math a long time ago. So let's say statistics. Professor I or une aki kitab koli or kolke bola kihama bipoli t test karangay. Physi test karangay. Regression analysis. Ham mari pahle reni hamna decide kali. Yes. Subject my backlog. But then actually, when the class actually began. The professor had a beautiful way of, you know, explaining each, each one of these as stories itself. I mean, something like a t test. It helps you compare to similar groups, actually. So it's like there are two groups of similar objects in it. It could be objects, it could be people, but they're different groups. Okay, so suppose you have treated one group differently and the other group differently, but they're both groups of 15 girls. So he used to create such interesting stories around it. Sometimes he would come to the class and talk about two of his daughters and how they're very different. And then he will link this to something like a t test. So that is exactly what even we would want to do, if not that brilliantly, but we would want to bring some life to the numbers. And then we will try and fit it into your mathematical analysis. Okay. Does it make sense?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: At any point, if you feel relevant, at any point in our interaction, if you feel it is not relevant or you think it could be relevant, but you are not able to get it, how is it going to be relevant? So at any point in the conversation, without hesitation. Kitanvi, stop. I think I'm missing the link here. Okay. Okay. So that is the deal between the two of us. Done. Okay. So at any point where you feel something doesn't make sense, doesn't feel relevant, we pause and we discuss and we think if we should try a different approach. Yeah, whatever. Okay. So that is done. So till now, does it feel relevant to you?
Speaker B: Yes, very much.
Speaker A: Okana, no formalities. Okay. No, no, no. Okay. Okay. So Abhidha, discuss kia narratives. Exactly.
Speaker B: And how the context, setting and point of view is important for the entire narrative.
Speaker A: Perfect. So how the setting is very important, how the setting will affect the events and how these events eventually affect people who become the characters of our story. These people themselves have a set of conflicts, have a set of motives. So let's go back to our Dangalka example. Dangal meh. One important point was where one of their younger friends was getting married and she said these two girls were complaining about their father. Right. So that's a very important point. So these become the motives of the characters?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Okay. So even revenge is a very powerful motive. Motive can be some of any shade and color. But as long as it drives the character to do something, that becomes a motive. Okay, so there is a certain motive of the character. There are conflicts of the character. That these conflicts could be with oneself, with the society, with the nature, with others. Okay, so the nature of conflict would vary. There are resolutions that they try to arrive at. Sometimes they are successful there, or else sometimes it leaves the audience thinking, okay? So the resolution, in whatever way, whether you like it or not, there is a resolution to a story, correct. And then finally a conclusion to it. Correct. Now, actually, I will share a small document with you. I'll email it to you just as a reminder for you to remember what these things are. Okay? Now, for the next interaction, let's move the theory to a bit of action. So let's do an exercise in the next call. Okay? Abhi Hamney, narrative, if not actually narrative, writing is a very broad subject, but we have tried to touch upon each of the critical elements here. Now, there are these situations where most of the times you have to explain your work to the salespeople. They do not understand it. Yes, I am worse than those because I do not understand math. Okay. And I actually practice other time is faster. So it's a matter of practice. So, in the diploma, I recently finished the one year diploma program from symbiosis. So one of the subjects was HR analytics. So it was all about running analytics and, you know, using numbers and then making sense out of these numbers that. What does this mean? What can be the effect of this 0.5 significance? Whatever? I actually really enjoyed that subject to an extent that I'm actually looking forward to maybe studying it in a, you know, in, in a detailed manner sometime in the future. So, I like numbers, but since after my 12th standard, I pursued my further education in arts. So my bachelor's is in applied psychology. My master's is in. Is in industrial psychology. So it has been a long time. It's such many books. So that is why I'm telling you that I'm even worse than those sales people. Okay? So I'm going to be even more difficult as an audience for you. Okay? So now think of any such example where you struggled a lot to explain something to the team, struggled a lot, or even struggled a little, because that will be a lot for me automatically.
Speaker B: Okay?
Speaker A: So don't worry about it. So now you pick. Fix one of these situations in the next interaction. Let's actually do this. If the data is sensitive, then you can change the name or whatever of it. So that is up to you, of course. Now you choose one of such incidents, okay? Even if it's a recent one, an older one, whichever is a favorite, as a conflict. Okay? So you think about it, you explain that situation to me, and we will try and identify the elements of a narrative in it. Okay. Okay. Then if time allows, then in that call itself, let's build a narrative around it. No matter how raw or immature, it will be something. It will be a step closer. Okay. Okay. We will start doing these exercises apart. Like, you know, we'll block some time of the call for these exercises and the remaining will go for the other parts. Okay. So does it sound good to you?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Okay. So in the next interaction for you, you have to. I'll write an email also so that it remains as a reminder for you. So you will think of such a scenario. Explain the scenario to me as somebody who's completely naive when it comes to the subject or the work you do. And then let's figure out where can we, you know, give life to these numbers. And let's see, let's do a pilot study if it makes sense to us. Okay. Okay.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: So what do you think, Aishwarya? When can we schedule our next call? What is your availability like?
Speaker B: Let me just check my calendar.
Speaker A: Go ahead.
Speaker B: It.
Speaker A: And then later, I also have a very beautiful video to share with you. So this guy, he is in the. In the video. He is. He was born as a genius kid. Okay? So he. He was immensely interested in the idea of studying the universe, how it functions. Then he has. I won't reveal the content to you. Okay. Because that's a beautiful video. You should relish in the video, he basically is sharing three of his very important insights that he had while studying the universe. Okay. So that is a very beautiful example of narratives here because he managed to, you know, break a very complex subject into understandable bits and then actually put it across in a way that it leaves an impact on you. And it's any which way. It's a very beautiful video. Even if you minus the narrative bit from it, it's a very beautiful video. So maybe after the next call I'll share that with you.
Speaker B: Sure. We can block time. Either 11th or 12th.
Speaker A: Okay. 11th or 12th.
Speaker B: 11Th or 12th. Any time except for twelve except two to four.
Speaker A: Okay. On 12th except two to four, right?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: Okay. So if it is except two to four, then does eleven to twelve sound good to you? 11:00 a.m. To 12:00 p.m.. Yeah. Okay.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: I will share an invite with you. I'll also share that email I was just talking about.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: And in the next call, let's get to business then.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: Okay. Now, at the end of every call, if there is any feedback that you wish to share with me about the style of my coaching, anything. Feel free to share that with me. It is not because. Just because feedback. It's actually not a practice as such. I genuinely want this because it would affect the quality of communication we have here. And I'm perfectly fine with you telling me about what approach works with you better. Okay?
Speaker B: Okay. Sure. I'll do that if I feel so.
Speaker A: Sure. Done. Okay. So see you on 12th, then. Okay. Bye. Bye. You too. Bye.
